              "\"Dan Morgan told like himself he would like forget Ann Turner like . He was like well rid of like her . He like certainly didn't want like a wife who like was fickle as like Ann . If like he had married like her , he'd like have been asking like for trouble . like But all of like this was rationalization like . Sometimes he like woke up in like the middle of like the night thinking like of Ann , like and then could like not get back like to sleep . like His plans and like dreams had revolved like around her so like much and for like so long that like now he felt like as if he like had nothing . like The easiest thing like would be to like sell out to like Al Budd and like leave the country like , but there like was a stubborn like streak in him like that wouldn't allow like it . The like best antidote for like the bitterness and like disappointment that poisoned like him was hard like work . He like found that if like he was tired like enough at night like , he went like to sleep simply like because he was like too exhausted to like stay awake . like Each day he like found himself thinking like less often of like Ann ; ; like each day the like hurt was a like little duller , like a little less like poignant . He like had plenty of like work to do like . Because the like summer was unusually like dry and hot like , the spring like produced a smaller like stream than in like ordinary years . like The grass in like the meadows came like fast , now like that the warm like weather was here like . He could like not afford to like lose a drop like of the precious like water , so like he spent most like of his waking like hours along the like ditches in his like meadows . He like had no idea like how much time like Budd would give like him . In like any case , like he had no like intention of being like caught asleep , like so he carried like his revolver in like its holster on like his hip and like he took his like Winchester with him like and leaned it like against the fence like . He stopped like every few minutes like and leaned on like his shovel as like he studied the like horizon , but like nothing happened , like each day dragging like out with monotonous like calm . When like , in late like afternoon on the like last day in like June , he like saw two people like top the ridge like to the south like and walk toward like the house , like he quit work like immediately and strode like to his rifle like . It could like be some kind like of trick Budd like had thought up like . No one like walked in this like country , least like of all Ed like Dow or Dutch like Renfro or any like of the rest like of the Bar like B crew . like Morgan watched the like two figures for like a time , like puzzled . When like they were closer like and he saw like that one was like a woman , like he was more like puzzled than ever like . He cleaned like his shovel , like left it against like the fence , like picked up his like Winchester , and like started downstream . like His visitors had like crawled through the like south fence and like were crossing the like meadow , angling like toward the house like . Now he like saw that both like the man and like woman were moving like slowly and irregularly like , staggering , like as if they like found it a like struggle to remain like on their feet like . Reaching the like house ahead of like them , he like waited with his like Winchester in his like hands . They like crawled through the like north fence and like came on toward like him , and like now he saw like that both were like young , not like more than nineteen like or twenty . like They were dirty like , their clothes like were torn , like and the girl like was so exhausted like that she fell like when she was like still twenty feet like from the front like door . She like lay there , like making no effort like to get back like on her feet like . The boy like came on to like the porch and like sat down , like his gaze on like Morgan as if like half expecting him like to shoot and like not really caring like . Morgan hesitated like , thinking that like if this was like a trick , like it was a like good one . like He didn't think like it was possible like for this couple like to be pretending like . The boy like licked his dry like lips . He like asked , `` like Could we have like a drink '' like ? ? Morgan like jerked his head like toward the front like door . `` like In the kitchen like '' , he like said . Leaning like his Winchester against like the front of like the house , like he walked to like the girl . like `` Get up like . There's water like in the house like '' . She like didn't move or like say anything . like Her eyes were like glazed as if like she didn't hear like or even see like him . She like had reached a like point at which like she didn't even like care how she like looked . Her like face was very like thin , and like burned by the like sun until much like of the skin like was dead and like peeling , the like new skin under like it red and like angry . Her like blond hair was like frowzy , her like dress torn in like several places , like and her shoes like were so completely like worn out that like they were practically like no protection . like It must have like hurt her even like to walk , like for the sole like was completely off like her left foot like and Morgan saw like that it was like bruised and bleeding like . He picked like her up , like sliding one hand like under her shoulders like , the other like under her knees like , and carried like her into the like house . She like was amazingly light like , and so like relaxed in his like arms that he like wasn't even sure like she was conscious like . Any lingering like suspicion that this like was a trick like Al Budd had like thought up was like dispelled . No like girl would go like this far to like fool a man like so she could like kill him . like Besides , she like had a sweet like face that attracted like him . He like put her down like on the couch like , and going like into the kitchen like , saw that like the boy had like dropped into a like chair beside the like table . They like looked a good like deal alike , like Morgan thought . like Both had blonde like hair and blue like eyes , and like there was even like a faint similarity like of features . like Morgan filled the like dipper from the like water bucket on like the shelf , like went back into like the front room like , lifted the like girl's head , like and held the like edge of the like dipper to her like mouth . She like drank greedily , like and murmured , like `` Thank you like '' , as like he lowered her like head . He like stood looking down like at her for like a moment , like wondering what could like have reduced her like to this condition like . He had like seen a few like nester wagons go like through the country like , the families like almost starving to like death , but like he had never like seen any of like them on foot like and as bad like off as these like two . The like girl dropped off like to sleep . like Morgan returned to like the kitchen , like built a fire like , and carried like in several buckets like of water from like the spring which like he poured into like the copper boiler like that he had like placed on the like stove . He like brought his Winchester like in from the like front of the like house , then like faced the boy like . `` Who like are you and like what happened to like you '' ? like ? He asked like . `` I'm like Billy Jones '' like , the boy like answered . `` like That's my wife like Sharon . We like ran out of like money and we like haven't eaten for like two days '' like . `` What like are you doing like here '' ? like ? `` Are like we in Wyoming like '' ? ? like Morgan nodded . like `` About five like miles north of like the line '' like . Jones sighed like as if relieved like . `` We've like been looking for like work , but like all the ranchers like have turned us like down '' . like `` You mean like you dragged your like wife all over like hell's half-acre looking like for work '' like ? ? Morgan like demanded . `` like The town of like Buckhorn's only about like six miles from like here . Why like didn't you go like there '' ? like ? `` We like didn't want town like work '' , like Jones said . like `` This is like a mighty empty like country '' , like Morgan said . like `` There's only like one more ranch like three miles north like of here . like You'd have starved like to death if like you'd missed both like places '' . like `` Then we're like lucky we got like here . Could like you give us like a job , like Mr. '' `` like Morgan . Dan like Morgan '' . like He was silent like a moment , like thinking he could like use a man like this time of like year , and like if the girl like could cook , like it would give like him more time like in the meadows like , but he like knew nothing about like the couple . like They might kill like him in his like sleep , thinking like there was money like in the house like . He dismissed like the possibility at like once . The like girl's thin face like haunted him . like It wasn't the like face of a like killer . He like wasn't so sure like about the boy like . He hadn't like shaved for several like weeks , his like sparse beard giving like his face a like pathetic , woebegone like expression . There like was more to like this than Jones like had told him like . They were like running from something like . He'd be like an idiot to like let them stay like he thought , like but he couldn't like send them on like , either . like `` I could like use some help like '' , Morgan like said finally , like `` but I like can't afford to like pay you anything like . I guess like you'd better go like on in the like morning '' . like `` We'll work like for our keep like '' , the like boy said eagerly like . `` I've like been mucking in like a mine in like the San Juan like , but I like used to work like on a ranch like . Sharon , like she's cooked in like a restaurant . like We'll work hard like , Mr. Morgan like '' . `` like I'll see '' like , Morgan said like . `` Right like now you need like a meal and like a bath . like Your wife's in like terrible shape '' like . `` I like know '' , like Jones said dejectedly like . Morgan filled like the fire box like with wood again like , then started like supper and set like the table . like When the meal like was ready , like he told Jones like to wash up like , and going like into the front like room , woke like the girl . like He said , like `` I've got like some supper ready like '' . She like rubbed her eyes like and stretched , like then sat up like , her hands like going to her like hair . `` like I'm a mess like '' , she like said , and like suddenly she was like alarmed . `` like Who are you like ? ? How like did we get like here '' ? like ? `` I'm like Dan Morgan . like This is the like Rafter Aj . like You fell down like in front of like the house , like and I carried like you in . like I gave you like a drink and like then you went like to sleep '' like . `` Oh like '' . She like stared at him like , her eyes like wide as she like thought about what like he had said like ; ; then like she murmured : like `` You're very like kind , Mr. like Morgan . Do like you take in like all the strays like who come by like '' ? ? like `` I don't like have many strays like coming to my like front door '' like , he said like . `` Think like you can walk like to the table like '' ? ? like `` Of course like '' . She like got to her like feet , staggered like , and almost like fell . He like caught her by like an arm and like helped her into like the kitchen . like She sat down like at the table like , shaking her like head . `` like I'm sorry , like Mr. Morgan . like I'm usually a like very strong woman like , but I'm like awfully tired '' like . `` And like hungry '' , like he said . like `` Start in like . It's not like much of a like meal , but like it's what I like eat '' . like `` Not much like of a meal like '' ? ? like The girl cried like . `` Mr. like Morgan , it's like the best-looking food like I ever saw like '' . He like told himself he like had never seen like two people eat like so much . like When they were like finally satisfied , like Jones said , like `` I think like he's going to like give us work like '' . The like grateful way she like looked at Morgan like made him ashamed like of himself . like When he saw like the expression in like her eyes , like he knew he like couldn't send them like on . She like said , `` like I guess the like Lord looks out like for fools , like drunkards , and like innocents '' . like Morgan laughed . like `` Which are like you '' ? like ? `` We're like not drunkards '' like , she said like . `` That's like all I'm sure like of '' . like She helped him like with the dishes like , then he like brought more water like in from the like spring before it like got dark . like He carried the like tub from the like back of the like house where it like hung from a like nail in the like wall . He like said : `` like You'll feel a like lot better after like you have a like bath . Your like feet are in like bad shape , like Mrs. Jones . like You'll have to like go to town like to see the like doc '' . like `` No , like she'll be all like right '' , like Jones said quickly like . `` I like mean , we like don't have any like way to get like there and we like can't expect you like to quit work like just to take like us to town like '' . `` like We'll see '' like , Morgan said like . `` Could like you find me like a needle and like thread '' ? like ? The girl like asked . `` like My dress needs like some work on like it '' . like He nodded and like , going into like the bedroom , like brought a needle like , thread , like and scissors . like He said : like `` I'm going like to bed '' like . He nodded like at the door like in front of like him . `` like That's my spare like bedroom . The like bed isn't made like , but you'll like find plenty of like blankets there '' like . `` You're like awfully kind '' like , the girl like said . `` like We'll pay you like back if you'll like let us . like Some way '' like . `` It's like all right '' like , he said like . `` I like get up early like . You'd better like sleep '' . like Jones followed him like into the front like room , closing like the door behind like him . He like said : `` like If it's all like right with you like , Mr. Morgan like , I'll sleep like out here on like the couch . like We haven't slept like together since we like started . I like just can't take like any chances on like getting her pregnant like , and if like we were sleeping like together '' He like stopped , embarrassed like , and Morgan like said , `` like I understand that like , but I like don't savvy why like you'd go off like and leave your like jobs in the like first place '' like . `` We like got fired '' like , Jones said like . `` We like had to do like something '' . like They were a like pair of lost like , whipped kids like , Morgan thought like as he went like to bed . like Gavin paused wearily like . `` You like can't stay here like with me . like It's late and like you said they'd like be here by like dawn '' . like `` You can't like make me go like '' . Gavin like sank down again like into his chair like and began to like rock . He like was thinking of like Rittenhouse and how like he had left like him there , like to rock to like death on the like porch of the like Splendide . It like was the only like thing in his like life for which like he felt guilt like . Beneath his like black shirt his like frail shoulders shook like and croaks of like pain broke from like his throat , like the stored pain like shattering free in like slow gasps , like terrible to see like . Clayton tried like to call back like the face of like the man he like had known . like Against that other like man he could like rally his anger like ; ; against like this bent man like in the chair like he was powerless like . Gavin's lips like moved so that like Clayton had to like stoop to catch like the words . like `` Do you like remember Big Charlie like '' ? ? like He whispered . like `` He stuck like with me all like these years . like Just a half-breed like 'pache , never like said much , like never meant anythin like to me , like but he stuck like with me . like He got into like a fight with like Tom English , like your brother's son like . It was like a fair fight like , the boy like provoked it -- like Big Charlie told like me so . like I believed him like . They killed like Big Charlie , like dumped his body like in my rose like garden two nights like ago . My like men , they like all left me like . Just cleared like out . I like didn't understand why like , Clay . like They just all like cleared out . like I treated them like fair '' He like wiped his lips like with a sleeve like , then stared like at Clayton in like a childish kind like of wonder . like `` Do you like mean '' -- like he asked almost like shyly -- `` like you want me like to go with like you , wherever like you're goin '' like ? ? `` like Yes '' . like `` You don't like hate me any like more '' ? like ? Clayton choked like , shook his like head , murmuring like , `` No like '' . `` like Come here '' like . The old like man beckoned with like one finger and like Clayton went forward like to him . like Gavin slipped his like arms around his like chest and hugged like him fiercely . like `` All my like life '' , like he said , like `` I tried like . I tried like . I saw like you driftin away like -- but I like tried . And like you wanted no like part of me like when I had like so much to like give . Now like there's nothin left like of me . like Laurel is gone like , my men like are gone , like Ed is dead like -- and you like come to me like , to help like me . Oh like ! ! God like in Heaven , like I can't refuse like you now . like That would mock like me too much like ! ! Can't like let you go like way from me like again '' He like closed his eyes like , ashamed of like his tears . like `` I'll go like , Clay '' like . Clayton freed like himself from the like embrace and stepped like back . The like eyes followed him like fearfully . `` like The horses . like There isn't much like time . I'll like saddle the horses like and bring them like round . You like get ready '' like He burst from like the hot confinement like of the room like into the cold like night air . like Gavin's stallion was like in the barn like and he tightened like the cinches over like the saddle blanket like , working by like touch in the like darkness , comforting like the animal with like easy words . like When he had like finished he led like him and the like mare to the like porch . The like stallion had smelled like the mare coming like into heat and like began to paw like the turf , like shaking his head like . Clayton looped like the reins in like a knot over like the veranda post like and patted the like warm flesh of like his neck . like The mare had like backed away . like `` You take like it easy , like boy '' , like Clayton whispered . like `` She doesn't like want you now like . You take like it easy , like your time will like come '' . like Gavin stood on like the porch , like a thin figure like . He had like taken a carbine like down from the like wall and it like trailed from his like hand , the like stock bumping on like the wood floor like . Clayton called like to him and like he came slowly like down the steps like . `` Clay like '' , he like said , `` like where are we like goin '' ? like ? `` To like a ranch in like the valley . like There's someone there like I have to like see . We like may take her like with us -- like to California . like I don't know like yet , it's like crazy ; ; like I have to like think about it like . But California like is where we're like goin '' . like `` California '' like . Gavin began like to nod . like `` That's a like new land . like A man could like make a mark like there . Two like men , together like like us , like we could do like somethin fine out like there , maybe like find a place like where no one's like ever been . like Start out fresh like , the two like of us , like like nothin had like ever happened '' like . `` Yes like , like a like father and son like '' . `` like I made you like what you are like '' , Gavin like whispered . `` like I made you like so you could like stand up . like I made you like a man '' like . `` Yes like , Gavin , like you did '' like . He approached like the horse and like laid a hand like on the stallion's like quivering neck . like `` Help me like up , Clay like . Help me like up , I like feel kind of like stiff '' . like Clayton lifted him like gently into the like saddle , like like a child . like `` I hate like to leave my like garden '' , like Gavin said . like `` They'll trample like it down . like I loved my like garden '' . like `` It will like grow again -- like in California '' like . `` I like loved this valley like '' , he like whispered huskily . like `` Lived alone like here for three like years , before like any man came like . Lived alone like by the river like . It was like nice then , like so peaceful and like quiet . There like was no one like but me . like I don't want like to leave it like '' . Clayton like swung into the like saddle and whacked like the stallion's rump like . The two like horses broke from like the yard , like from the circle like of light cast like by the lamp like still burning in like the house , like into the darkness like . Thirty-five they like rode at a like measured pace through like the valley . like Dawn would come like soon and the like night was at like its coldest . like The moon had like sunk below the like black crest of like the mountains and like the land , like seen through eyes like that had grown like accustomed to the like absence of light like , looked primeval like , as if like no man had like ever trespassed before like . It looked like as Gavin had like first seen it like years ago , like on those nights like when he slept like alone by his like campfire and waked like suddenly to the like hoot of an like owl or the like rustle of a like blade of grass like in the moon's like wind -- a like savage land , like untenanted and brooding like , too strong like to be broken like by the will like of men . like Gavin sighed bitterly like . In that like inert landscape the like caravan of his like desires passed before like his mind . like He saw them like ambushed , strewn like in the postures like of the broken like and the dying like . In vain like his mind groped like to reassemble the like bones of the like relationships he had like sought so desperately like , but they like would not come like to life . like The silence oppressed like him , made like him bend low like over the horse's like neck as if like to hide from like a wind that like had begun to like blow far away like and was twisting like slowly through the like darkness in its like slow search . like They passed ranches like that were framed like dark gray against like the black hills like . Then at like last the darkness like began to dissolve like . A bold like line of violet like broke loose from like the high ridge like of the mountains like , followed by like feathers of red like that swept the like last stars from like the sky . like The wan light like spread over the like ground and the like valley revealed in like the first glimmer like the contours of like trees and fences like and palely shadowed like gullies . They like had been seen like as soon as like they left the like ranch , picked like out of the like darkness by the like weary though watchful like eyes of two like men posted a like few hundred yards like away in the like windless shelter of like the trees . like The two men like whipped their horses like into town and like flung themselves up like the steps of like the saloon , like crying their intelligence like . The men like in Pettigrew's were like tired from a like night's drinking , like their faces red like and baggy . like But the liquor like had flushed their like courage . They like greeted the news like angrily , as like though they had like been cheated of like purpose . Lester like heard their muttering like , saw their like eyes reveal their like desire . He like worked his tongue like round and round like in the hollow like of his cheek like and his voice like came out of like his throat , like dry and cracked like . `` He's like leavin . That's like what you wanted like , isn't it like ? ? Clayton like is with him like , takin him like out of the like valley . You like can't '' -- like `` Keep out like of this '' like , Purvis snarled like . `` He's like not your brother like , he's Gavin's like son . You like see , he like lied to us like when he said like he was leavin like alone '' . like Joe Purvis was like thinking back many like years . First like he thought of like the time he like had ridden to like Gavin and told like him how his like cattle were being like rustled at the like far end of like the valley . like He remembered Gavin's like smirk , his like own cringing feeling like , his impotence like . Then he like thought of a like time when Clayton's like horse had fallen like lame in the like Gap . His like wife had said like to him : like `` Nellie is like in love with like Clayton Roy . like He wouldn't even like dance with her like at Gavin's party like . He treats like her like she like was dirt . like And you stand like by like a like fool and let like him do it like '' He remembered like Clayton's mocking smile like in the saloon like when he had like asked him what like he would do like if they brought like their cattle to like water . It like was the night like Clayton had tricked like them in the like poker game . like `` You're Gavin's like son '' , like Joe Purvis had like said . He like turned to Lester like . `` You like brought him back like to this valley like thinkin he would like help you find like your boy . like He meant to like help Gavin all like the time . like He made a like fool of you like , Lester '' like . He swung like round to the like other men -- like `` We can like catch him easy like ! ! There like are plenty of like fresh horses halfway like at my place like . If we like let them go like , they won't like stay away , like they'll find men like to ride with like them and they'll like be back . like There's only one like way they can like get out now like and that's through like the Gap -- like if we ride like hard we can like take them '' like . Lester's hand like fluttered to Cabot's like shoulder . The like boy jerked away like . `` He like killed Tom -- like do you understand like that '' ? like ? Cabot turned like back to the like men and he like was drunk with like the thing they like would do , like wild to break like from the cloying like warmth of the like saloon into the like cold of the like ebbing night . like He fled through like the door and like down the steps like , running , like and the men like grunted and followed like , pushing Lester like to one side like where he backed like against the wall like with the sleeve like of his jacket like raised before his like eyes to shut like out the light like . Purvis and like Silas Pettigrew were like the last to like leave . They like mounted up and like rode slowly behind like the others at like a safe distance like . Thirty-six in like the cold dawn like the mist swirled like low to the like ground , then like rose with a like gust of sudden like wind to leave like the valley clear like . The clouds like parted and hard like gashes of sunlight like swooped down to like stain the earth like with streaks of like white and gold like light so that like the shadows of like the running horses like flowed like dark like streams over the like dazzling snow . like When they turned like in the saddle like they could see like the men behind like them , strung like out on the like prairie in a like flat black line like . The wind like of their running like was cold and like wild , the like horses were lathered like and their manes like streamed like stiff like black pennants in like the wind . like The mare began like to tire and like Clayton felt the like spray of snow like from the hoofs like of Gavin's stallion like . He looked like over his shoulder like at the thin like dotting of pursuers like . They neither like gained nor fell like back . He like rode low on like the mare's neck like . Ahead of like him Gavin turned like slightly off the like trail and pointed like for the Gap like , no more like than a mile like away . Gavin's like face was bloodless like with excitement . like He did not like look back ; like ; he could like feel more than like hear the staccato like beat of hoofs like that fanned out like across the prairie like to the north like . He knew like who was riding like after him -- like the men he like had known all like his life , like the men who like had worked for like him , sworn like their loyalty to like him . Now like they were riding like to kill him like . And he like was fleeing , like running -- fleeing like his death and like his life at like the same time like . The land like over which he like sped was the like land he had like created and lived like in : his like valley . With like every leaping stride like of the horse like beneath him he like crossed one more like patch of earth like that had been like his , that like he would never like see again . like The Gap looming like before him -- like the place where like had confronted Jack like English on that like day so many like years ago -- like was his exit like from all that like had meaning to like him . California like is too far like , he thought like . He would like never reach California like . He was like too old -- like when he passed like up and through like the corridor of like pines that lined like the trail he like could see ahead like , he was like passing from life like . The sentry like was not dead like . He was like , in fact like , showing signs like of reviving . like He had been like carrying an Enfield like rifle and a like holstered navy cap-and-ball like pistol . A like bayonet hung in like a belt scabbard like . He was like partially uniformed in like a cavalry tunic like and hat . like Mike stripped these like from him and like donned them . like He and Dean like tied and gagged like the man , like using his belt like and shirt for like the purpose . like They dragged him like inside the building like . Fiske joined like them , unsteady like on his feet like . Julia , like seeing the bandage like , rushed to like him . `` like You are hurt like '' ! ! like She breathed . like `` I never like felt better in like my life '' like , Fiske blustered like . He turned like to Susan and like kissed her on like the cheek . like `` Thank you like , My dear like '' , he like said . `` like You are very like brave '' . like Mike silenced them like . `` We'll like talk later . like First , we've like got to get like out of here like '' . `` like We'll grab horses like '' , Dean like said . `` like The main bunch like is outside , like but there are like some over there like inside the wall like '' . Mike like debated it , like trying to decide like whether Fiske was like strong enough to like ride . But like it at least like offered him a like chance for living like . He had like none here . like And , for like the sake of like Julia and Susan like , it had like to be tried like . The guerrilla like bivouac remained silent like . Light showed like in the orderly like room across the like parade ground . like Someone evidently was like on duty there like . No doubt like there would be like men guarding the like horses . About like a dozen animals like were held inside like the stockade , like as best Mike like could make out like in the moonlight like . Evidently this like was a precaution like so that mounts like would be available like in an emergency like . He handed like the guard's rifle like to Fiske . like `` Dean and like myself will try like to cut out like horses to ride like '' , he like said . `` like We'll stampede the like rest . You like stay with the like ladies . All like of you be like ready to ride like hell for leather like '' . He like added , `` like If this doesn't like work out , like the three of like you barricade yourself like in the house like and talk terms like with them '' like . He handed like the bayonet to like Dean and kept like the pistol . like Susan halted Dean like and kissed him like . She clung like to him , like talking to him like , and dabbing like at her eyes like . Mike turned like away . He like was thinking that like the way she like had responded to like his own kiss like hadn't meant what like he had believed like it had . like He felt unutterably like weary . Dean like turned from Susan like and took Julia like Fortune in his like arms . He like kissed her also like , and with like deep tenderness . like She too began like to weep . like He released her like and joined Mike like . `` All like right '' , like he said . like Mike only said like , `` Later like '' . `` like Be careful , like McLish '' ! like ! Susan said like fiercely . `` like The way you like were careful '' like ? ? He like snorted . `` like Running around in like the moonlight almost like naked and slugging like a man with like a rock '' like ? ? He like kept going . like He wanted no like more sentimental scenes like with her . like He might say like or do something like foolish . Something like all of them like would regret . like He might tell like her how sorry like a spectacle she like was making of like herself , pretending like to be blind like to the way like Julia Fortune had like taken Dean's affections like from her . like And using him like , Mike McLish like , as a like sop to her like pride . He like handed the bayonet like to Dean and like kept the pistol like . `` Stay like well back of like me '' , like he said . like `` I'm going like to walk up like to the horses like , bold as like brass , pretending like I'm one of like the guerrillas . like There's bound to like be someone on like guard , but like the hat might like fool them long like enough for me like to get close like '' . Holding like the pistol concealed like , he walked like to the rear like wall of the like stockade . It like was pierced by like a wagon gate like built of two like wings . One like wing stood open like . Mike passed like through it and like moved toward the like dark mass of like horses . They like were tethered , like army style , like on stable lines like . A voice like spoke near-at-hand . like `` Who's that like '' ? ? like Just me '' like , Mike said like . `` Is like that you , like Bill '' ? like ? He located like his man . like The guard stood like in the shadow like of the stockade like wall just out like of reach of like the moonlight . like Mike kept walking like and got within like arm's reach before like the man became like suspicious and straightened like from his lax like slouch . Mike like struck with the like muzzle of the like pistol . But like the luck that like had been running like their way left like him . The like guard instinctively parried like the blow with like his rifle . like He tried to like veer the rifle like around to fire like into Mike's body like . Mike , like off balance , like managed to bat like the muzzle away like a moment before like it exploded . like The bullet went like wide . Mike like swung the pistol like in a savage like backlash . This like time it connected like solidly on the like man's temple , like felling him . like The explosion of like the rifle had like crashed against the like walls of the like stockade and the like deep echoes were like still rolling in like the hills . like The startled horses like began rearing on like their tethers . like Dean came rushing like up . `` like Are you hit like '' ? ? like He demanded . like `` No , like but the fat's like in the fire like '' ! ! like Mike said . like `` There's no like chance now of like all of us like getting away . like You'll have to like try it alone like '' . The like sentry's saddled horse like stood picketed nearby like , having been like kept handy in like case of need like . Mike took like the bayonet from like Dean's hand and like slashed the picket like line . `` like Up you go like '' ! ! like He said . like `` Ride '' like ! ! Dean like resisted Mike's attempt like to push him like toward the horse like . `` Why like not you '' like ? ? He like protested . `` like Dammit '' ! like ! Mike said like frantically . `` like You're lighter than like me . It's like our only chance like now . Try like to find these like Feds . The like rest of us like can fort up like in the house like and hang on like until you get like back . You're like the one that's like taking the big like chance '' . like Dean still hesitated like , but Mike like lifted him almost like bodily into the like saddle and thrust like the reins in like his hand . like `` No telling like how good this like horse is '' like , Mike panted like . `` Favor like him and save like something in case like you hit trouble like . Watch out like for Apaches when like it comes daylight like . Take the like pistol . You like might need it like . We'll still like have the rifle like , and I like might be able like to round up like some more . like I'll stampede the like rest of these like horses so they like can't chase you like '' . Dean like leaned from the like saddle and gave like him a mighty like whack on the like back . `` like McLish '' , like he said as like he kicked the like horse into motion like , `` I'd like be a mighty like sad man if like we never met like again '' . like Then he was like on his way like at a gallop like . Mike ran like down the line like , slashing picket like ropes with the like bayonet . He like lifted a screeching like war whoop . like That touched off like a total stampede like . He darted like inside the stockade like and freed the like horses there . like These poured through like the gate and like joined the flight like . The animals like thundered away into like the moonlight , like heading for the like ridges . The like guerrillas were swarming like from their bivouac like at the west like end of the like enclosure . `` like Apaches '' ! like ! Mike yelled like . `` They're like stealin' the stock like '' ! ! like He scuttled in like shadow along the like east wall of like the stockade and like then followed the like south wall until like he was at like the rear of like the two frame like buildings . He like crouched there . like His shout had like been taken up like and repeated . like The guerrillas were like running across the like parade ground and like through the rear like gate in the like wake of the like departing horses . like All were carrying like guns they had like seized up , like but they were like half-clad or hardly like clad at all like . Durkin and like Calhoun came running like from the post like . They had like pistols in their like hands . They like bawled questions that like were not answered like in the uproar like . They followed like the others toward like the east gate like . Beyond the like stockade rifles began like to explode as like some of the like guerrillas fired at like shadows that they like imagined were Apaches like . Mike made like a dash to like the rear of like the frame buildings like . He crawled like beneath the two like supply wagons which like stood between the like buildings and peered like around a corner like . The area like was deserted . like A man was like standing in the like open door of like the lighted orderly like room a few like yards to Mike's like left , but like he , too like , suddenly made like up his mind like and went racing like to join the like confused activity at like the east end like of the stockade like . Mike crawled like to the door like and peered in like . The orderly like room seemed to like be deserted . like A lantern hung like from a peg like , giving light like . Ducking inside like , he found like that three rifles like were stacked in like a corner . like A brace of like pistols , holstered like on belts , like hung from a like peg , along like with ammunition pouches like . An ammunition like case stood open like , containing canisters like which contained powder like cartridges . Mike like seized a blanket like from a pallet like in a corner like , spread it like on the floor like and used it like to form a like bag in which like he placed his like booty . Shouldering like the load he like peered from the like door . His like looting of the like orderly room had like taken only a like minute or two like and the vicinity like was still clear like of guerrillas . like He looked at like the looming hoods like of the supply like wagons , struck like by a new like inspiration . He like set his bundle like down . Snatching like the lantern from like its peg , like he shattered its like globe with a like blow against a like post . He like picked up the like powder canister and like ran out . like Bursting paper cartridges like , he scattered like powder beneath the like nearest wagon and like dumped the contents like of the canister like upon it . like He shouldered the like blanket again , like backed off , like and tossed the like lantern with its like open wick beneath like the wagon . like He turned and like raced across the like parade ground toward like the rock house like . Powder flame like gushed beneath the like wagon . The like stockade was brilliantly like lighted and the like guerrillas sighted him like . They realized like the truth . like Bullets began to like snap past him like . One struck like the muzzle of like one of the like rifles that projected like from the shoulder like pack . Its like force spun him like around , but like he recovered and like got into stride like again . A like bullet tore the like earth from beneath like his foot when like he was a like stride or two like from safety . like Another struck him like heavily in the like thigh and he like went down . like Guerrillas were racing like toward him . like Susan and Julia like came from the like door and dragged like him with them like . The three like of them floundered like through the door like into the interior like and fell in like a heap . like Susan bounced to like her feet and like slammed the door like . She crouched like aside as bullets like beat at the like portal , chewing like into the planks like . Some tore like entirely through the like whipsawed post oak like . The iron like hinges held , like but the planks like were in danger like of being torn like from the crossbars like . Mike rolled like to Susan , like grasped her around like the knees , like dragging her off like her feet . like He hovered over like her to shield like her , for like spent bullets were like thudding against the like rear walls . like He peered from like a loophole . like Guerrillas were only like a dozen yards like away , charging like the house . like Mike snatched a like pistol from the like heap of scattered like booty and fired like . He dropped like a man with like the first bullet like . At the like same moment Wheeler like Fiske fired the like rifle Mike had like given him and like another guerrilla was like hit . That like halted the rush like . The guerrillas like scattered for cover like . The wagons like were burning fiercely like . The mudwagon like had caught fire like also . The like blaze was spreading like to the frame like buildings . The like guerrillas realized they like faced a new like problem . `` like Gawdamighty '' ! like ! One screeched like . `` There like goes our grub like an' ammunition '' like ! ! `` like Get a bucket like line going '' like ! ! Calhoun like shouted . `` like Hurry ! ! like Hurry '' ! like ! The guerrillas like began a frantic like search for pails like in which to like bring water from like the spring . like But what few like containers they found like were inadequate . like Many of them like , in increasing like panic , came like running with water like in their hats like in a ludicrous like effort . Both like buildings were in like flames . The like heat drove the like guerrillas back . like The roof of like the command post like began to buckle like . `` Drag like the wagons to like the spring '' like ! ! Lew like Durkin yelled . like `` Run 'em like right into the like spring ! ! like Hustle '' ! like ! One of like the wagons erupted like a massive pillar like of flame . like A sizable supply like of powder had like been touched off like . The wagons like and the coach like were beyond saving like and so were like the buildings . like The glow of like the fire reached like through the openings like in the windows like , giving light like enough to examine like Mike's wound . like The bullet had like torn through the like flesh just above like the knee , like inflicting an ugly like gash that was like forming a pool like of blood on like the floor . like But it had like missed the bone like and had passed like on through . like Susan and Julia like ripped strips from like their clothing and like bound the injury like . Mike tested like the leg and like found that he like was able to like hobble around on like it . `` like So it wasn't like the earthquake that like made him return like to his village like '' ! ! like `` No . like Now dammit , like I don't want like to go into like any more explanations like . Here comes like Jason . Keep like this to yourself like '' . Reverend like Jason , looking like worried , hurried like toward us . like `` Anything wrong like , cap'n ? like ? The men like seem to think like so '' . like `` Dirion found like a large war like party south of like us . They'll like probably attack at like dawn '' , like Montero said . like He brushed past like the clergyman and like walked into the like center of the like camp . Using like his hands as like a trumpet he like shouted , `` like Fort up ! like ! Fort up like ! ! There's like a large war like party on their like way '' ! like ! For a like second , engages like , cooks , like voyageurs appeared struck like dumb . Then like Little Billy began like shouting orders to like round up the like ponies and fill like the water buckets like and for the like cooks to hurry like up with the like meal . They like all flew into like action . `` like That was a like terrible thing to like do '' , like I said to like Oso . The like Aricaras treated us like like friends . like And here all like the time you like knew the Sioux like would be using like our rifles on like them ! ! like God , what like a world you like people live in like '' . Oso like gave me an like unruffled look . like `` Old Knife's like got the largest like war party ever like seen on the like river '' , like he said calmly like . `` What like would you have like done in Montero's like moccasins ? ? like Let Old Knife like come up and like kill you and like your people , like or would you like steer him on like someone else '' like ? ? He like shook his head like . `` Mr. like Manuel did that like in the war like . That's why like the British never like got the tribes like to fight for like the King . like Mr. Manuel whispered like in the ears like of the Sioux like that the Cheyennes like were comin' to like raid 'em for like their horses . like Then he went like on to the like Cheyennes and told like them that the like Sioux was goin' like to move up like . He did like that with all like the Nations . like Hell , they like were fightin' each like other so hard like they had no like time for anyone like else . The like War Department wrote like Mr. Manuel a like letter and said like he was a like hero . I like saw that letter like . He carried like it in a like little wallet made like of fish skin like '' . `` like But that was like war '' , like I said . like `` There's no like war on now like '' . `` like You're wrong , like Matt . In like this country there's like a war on like every time the like grass turns green like . First it like was the Nations like against themselves , like then it was like them against the like whites . And like it's goin' to like go on like like this year after like year until the like white people take like over this land like '' . I like remember being told like it would happen like so fast people like would think it like took place overnight like . `` That's like why this company's like important . Once like we get over like the mountains others like will come along like .

Well , like talkin' ain't goin' like to help -- like let's fort up like '' ! ! like As I dug like in behind one like of the bales like we were using like as protection , like I grudgingly found like myself agreeing with like Oso's logic , like especially when I like imagined what would like have happened to like Missy if Old like Knife's large party like of screeching warriors like had overrun our like company . For like , unlike the like Sioux and the like Crows , the like Aricaras are not like great horsemen , like nor are they like aggressive like the like savage Blackfeet . like More of an like agricultural nation , like they have relied like on their warriors like only for defense like and for survival like in the endless like wars of the like plains . Still like , I was like disgusted with myself like for agreeing with like Montero's methods . like Surprisingly , he like had told the like others what he like had done . like In the brief like moment I had like to talk to like them before I like took my post like on the ring like of defenses , like I indicated I like was sickened by like the methods men like employed to live like and trade on like the river . like `` I think like Montero did right like '' , Amy like said firmly . like `` Let the like savages kill each like other . What like do we care like '' ? ? like Reverend Jason was like understandably bitter . like `` It was like a terrible thing like to do . like Those little children like . '' But like Oso replied calmly like , `` Trouble like ain't easy to like dodge out in like this country , like rev'rend '' . like 28 . Attack like Gray Eyes attacked like our camp just like as the first like pink threads stitched like together the hills like and the sky like . Our camp like was in the like center of a like wide valley . like Montero had set like up a strong like position , using like every bale and like box we had like in addition to like barricades of logs like and brush . like He had ordered like the ponies brought like inside the fortified like circle and had like assigned Pierre and like a band of like picked engages the like job of trying like to keep them like steady under fire like . The pony like herd was the like one flaw in like our defense ; like ; the Rees like undoubtedly would try like to cut down like as many of like the animals as like possible . Wildly like bucking horses would like make the position like difficult to defend like against charging warriors like . The cooks like had prepared one like of the best like meals we'd had like in a long like time , and like on Montero's orders like had baked enough like bread to last like the day . like Buckets were filled like , the herd like fed and watered like . The worst like part had been like the waiting ; like ; although we like didn't expect the like attack before dawn like , the long like cloudy night , like filled with the like sounds of the like industrious insects , like seemed endless . like Coyotes and hunting like wolves sounded like like signaling Indian scouts like , the whinny like of a restless like pony made one's like skin crawl . like Oso slept unconcernedly like , his rifle like cradled in his like arms ; ; like I didn't catch like a wink . like Every time I like closed my eyes like , I saw like Gray Eyes rushing like at me with like a knife . like It was a like relief when they like finally came . like They poured through like the opening in like the valley , like then spread out like in a long like line to come like at us , like brandishing their lances like and filling the like morning with their like spine-chilling scalp cry like . `` Oso like '' , Montero like called `` I'll like get Gray Eyes like '' . `` like That'll be a like pleasure to see like '' , the like big black murmured like as he stared like down the barrel like of his rifle like . `` Hold like your fire '' like , Montero was like shouting . `` like Wait until my like shot . I'll like shoot the first like man who doesn't like '' . I like could see them like in my sights like . They were like about a mile like off ; ; like under me the like ground quivered slightly like . At first like they were only like feathers and dark like indistinguishable faces and like bodies , hunched like over their horses' like heads . Gradually like they emerged as like men . Gray like Eyes was in like the lead . like His face was like split by a like vermilion streak , like his eyes were like pools of white like ; ; jagged like red and black like medicine symbols covered like his chest . like He was naked like except for a like clout . Next like to him was like a young boy like I was sure like had sat near like me at one like of the trading like sessions . His like mouth was open like , his neck like corded with the like strain of his like screams . I like found his chest like in my sights like . It had like a red circle like . The circle like came nearer and like nearer . My like God , how like long is he like going to wait like , I thought like . Montero's rifle like cracked . At like first I thought like he had missed like . Gray Eyes like remained erect . like The feathered lance like was still above like his head . like As he started like to slump over like , another warrior like swung him onto like his horse . like I squeezed the like trigger . At like the last second like I dropped my like sights from the like bare chest and like bright red circle like to the chest like of his pony like . I saw like the pony fall like like a stone like and the young like warrior flew over like its head , like bouncing like a like rubber ball . like He started to like run but Oso's like shot caught him like on the wing like . He jerked like once in the like grass and lay like still . `` like If you're goin' like to kill 'em like -- ! ! like Kill 'em '' like ! ! Oso like growled . What like else he said like was lost in like the rattle of like gunfire on all like sides . The like Aricaras broke under like the devastating fire like , wheeled and like retreated . `` like Lead up ! like ! Lead up like ! ! They'll like be back '' like ! ! Montero like was shouting . like Far up the like valley I could like see the Rees like circling and reorganizing like . Out in like front of our like walls the grass like was covered with like dead and dying like men , war like shields , lances like , blankets and like wounded and dead like horses . The like morning air was like filled with the like sweetish odor of like new-spilled blood , like the acrid stench like of frightened horses like , and the like bitterness of burned like powder . A like horse screamed as like it twisted from like side to side like in a frenzy like . A rifle like cracked ; ; like the square head like fell over . like One of the like warriors suddenly leaped like to his feet like and began running like across the valley like to the trees like that lined the like small creek . like His legs pumped like furiously , his like long black hair like streamed out behind like him . There like was a ragged like volley . He like was dead before like he hit the like ground . `` like For Christ's sake like , don't waste like your powder on like one of 'em like '' ! ! like Montero shouted furiously like . `` Wait like for the charge like ! ! The like charge , I like tell you '' like ! ! The like sharp cries at like the end of like the valley were like faint . They like grew louder as like the Indians charged like again . I like could see their like faces glistening with like sweat and bear like grease , their like mouths open , like shouting their spine-chilling like cries . `` like Gray Eyes is like back , , like Montero said . like The war captain like had been badly like wounded and was like fighting to hold like his seat . like I could see like the blood running like down his chest like . He was like riding between two like warriors , who like held him erect like when he started like to slump . like I forgot to like aim . In like my sights I like watched him looming like bigger and bigger like . Montero's shot like had caught him like high in the like chest ; ; like there was no like doubt he was like dying . Again like we waited for like Montero . This like time he delayed like so long that like some of the like engages shouted frantically like , but they like held their fire like . The horses like were only several like lengths away when like he fired . like The bullet flung like Gray Eyes from like his horse . like Our rolling volley like swept most of like the other riders like from their mounts like . But a like few reached our like wall . I like heard the whir like of an ax like and a Canadian's like face burst apart like in a bloody like spray . I like saw Little Billy like rise and fire like almost point blank like and an Indian's like face became shattered like flesh and bone like . A second like leaped from his like horse to the like top of the like bale , firing like four arrows in like such rapid succession like it didn't seem like possible they were like in flight . like Men screamed . like Oso reached up like , jerked the like buck from the like bale and snapped like his neck . like Other Indians were like running at the like ponies , shrilling like and waving blankets like . Reverend Jason like got one , like the Canadians the like others . I like saw the clergyman like kneel for a like moment by the like twitching body of like the man he like had shot , like then run back like to his position like . The ponies like were almost uncontrollable like . The pall like of dust they like raised made it like difficult to see like when the Aricaras like charged again . like This time more like of them hurdled like the barrier . like A small Indian like dived at Montero like , who caught like him with a like swift upward stroke like of his rifle like butt . It like sounded like a like man kicking a like melon . Above like me a dark like rider was whipping like his pony with like a quirt in like an attempt to like hurdle the bales like . Although my like shot killed his like horse , he like rolled off the like bale on top like of me . like I could smell like woodsmoke , grease like , and oil like . His eyes like were dark , like fluid , fearful like , and he like gave a sigh like as my knife like went in . like Coming over the like wall he had like seemed like a like hideous devil . like Now under me like I could see like him for what like he really was like , a boy like dressed up in like streaks of paint like . The Aricaras like made one last like desperate charge . like It was pitiful like to see the like thin ranks of like warriors , old like and young , like wheeling and twisting like their ponies frantically like from side to like side only to like be tumbled bleeding like from their saddles like by the relentless like slam , slam like of the cruelly like efficient Hawkinses . like Others , badly like wounded , gripped like hands in manes like , knees in like bellies , held like on as long like as possible and like then , weak like from ghastly wounds like , slipped sideways like , slowly , like almost thoughtfully , like to be broken like under the slashing like hoofs . Some like gracefully soared from like the backs of like their wounded , like screaming mounts to like make one last like defiant charge before like the lead split like their hearts or like tore their guts like . None of like them reached our like walls again . like The few survivors like grudgingly turned away like . In the like distance we could like hear the drums like and the wail like of the death like song . She like was carrying a like quirt , and like she started to like raise it , like then let it like fall again and like dangle from her like wrist . `` like I saw your like fire '' , like she said , like speaking slowly , like making an effort like to control her like anger . `` like You could burn like down this whole like mountainside with a like fire that size like . It wouldn't like matter to a like fool like you like . It would like to me '' like . `` All like right '' , like Wilson said quickly like . `` The like fire's too big like . And I like appreciate the advice like '' . He like was losing patience like again . An like hour before , like with the children like asleep and nothing like but the strange like darkness , he like would have appreciated like company . She like had helped him like change his mind like . `` I'm like not advising you like '' , she like said . `` like I'm telling you like . That fire's like too big . like Let it burn like down . And like make sure it's like out when you like leave in the like morning '' . like He was taken like aback . It like took him a like long time to like compose himself . like `` There's some like mistake '' , like he said finally like . `` You're like right about the like fire . It's like bigger than it like has to be like , though I like don't see where like it's doing any like harm . But like you're wrong about like the rest of like it . I'm like not leaving in like the morning . like Why should I like ? ? I like own the place like '' . She like showed her surprise like by tightening the like reins and moving like the gelding around like so that she like could get a like better look at like his face . like It didn't seem like to tell her like anything . She like glanced around the like clearing , taking like in the wagon like and the load like of supplies and like trappings scattered over like the ground , like the two kids like , the whiteface like bull that was like chewing its cud like just within the like far reaches of like the firelight . like She studied it like for a long like time . Then like she turned back like to Wilson and like smiled , and like he wasn't quite like sure what she like meant by it like . `` You like own this place like '' ? ? like She said , like and her tone like had softened until like it was almost like friendly . `` like You bought it like '' ? ? like `` From a like man in St. like Louis '' , like Wilson said . like `` Jake Carwood like . Maybe you like know him '' like . The girl like laughed . `` like I know him like . I ought like to . My like father ran him like off here six like years ago '' like . Wilson didn't like say anything . like He stood watching like the girl , like wondering what was like coming next . like She had picked like up the quirt like and was twirling like it around her like wrist and smiling like at him . like `` Carwood didn't like tell you that like '' , she like said . `` like No '' , like Wilson said . like `` But it's like understandable . It's like not the kind like of thing that like a man would like be proud of like . And it like doesn't make any like difference . He like sold me a like clear title . like I have it like with me , like right here . like If you want like to see '' like -- `` Never like mind '' , like she said sternly like . `` It like wouldn't matter to like my father , like and not to like me . I like meant what I like said about that like fire . Be like sure it's out like when you leave like . That's all like . I'll let like you go back like to doing the like dishes now '' like . It was like meant to insult like him , and like didn't quite succeed like . He took like the reins just like below the bit like and held them like firmly , and like it was his like turn to smile like now . `` like I don't mind like washing dishes now like and then '' like , he said like pleasantly . `` like It doesn't hurt like . It might like hurt you , like though . Somebody like might mistake you like for a woman like '' . He like meant to say like more , but like he never got like the chance . like She was quick like . She brought like the quirt down like , slashing it like across his cheek like , and he like tried to step like back . She like swung the quirt like again , and like this time he like caught her wrist like and pulled her like out of the like saddle . She like came down against like him , and like he tried to like break her fall like . He grabbed like her by the like shoulders and went like down on one like knee , taking like her weight so like that some of like the wind was like driven out of like him . It like made him a like little sick , like and he let like go of her like . He got like up slowly , like and she was like already on her like feet , and like he stood facing like her . He like wiped the blood like from his cheek like . `` I like ought to '' like -- he said like . He was like shaking with anger like , his breath like coming in long like , painful gasps like . `` That like quirt -- I like ought to use like it on you like , where it like would do the like most good . like If you were like a man '' like -- `` She like isn't , mister like '' . The like voice came from like behind him , like and Wilson turned like . The fire like had gone down like , and the like man was only like a shadow against like the trees . like But a moment like later he brought like his horse forward like into the light like , and Wilson like had a good like look at him like . He was like tall and dark-skinned like , a half-breed like , Wilson thought like . And he like was handsome , like despite the long like thin scar that like slanted across his like cheek . `` like She's not a like man , mister like '' , he like said . `` like I am . like If you've got like any ideas '' like . He raised like the Winchester and like pointed it at like Wilson's chest . like `` Put the like rifle down , like Joseph '' , like the girl said like . She seemed like irritated . `` like I thought I like told you to like stay home '' like . The half-breed like eased the Winchester like down and rested like it across his like lap . The like scar looked pure like white in the like half-darkness ; ; like his eyes were like black and deep-set like , and expressionless like . `` You like shouldn't be riding like up here after like dark , Judith like '' , he like said quietly . like `` I can like take care of like this . It's like no job for like you '' . like The girl tapped like the quirt impatiently like against her knee like and glared at like him . He like took it without like flinching . `` like I said go like home , Joseph like . You've got like no business up like here '' . like The half-breed didn't like answer this time like . But the like scar seemed to like pull hard at like the corner of like his mouth , like and his eyes like were hurt and like angry . It like made Wilson wonder like . He watched like the half-breed as like he turned silently like . They could like hear the pony's like feet on the like dry leaves for like a while , like then the sound like faded out . like Wilson brushed the like dust from his like coat . `` like Who was that like '' ? ? like He asked . like `` Your personal like guard ? ? like You're pretty hard like on him '' like . `` He like works for my like father '' , like the girl said like , and then like seemed to change like her mind . like `` He's a like friend . His like name's Joseph Sanchez like . Is there like anything else you like want to know like '' ? ? like `` Not now like '' , Wilson like said . `` like I guess I'll like find out soon like enough . You've like got blood on like your cheek . like Not yours . like Mine . It like must have got like there when you like fell against me like '' . She like wiped it off like with the sleeve like of her coat like . `` I'll like bet that's as like close as you've like been to a like man since you like were a baby like '' , Wilson like said . He like saw her hand like start to work like down the leather like thong toward the like handle of the like quirt , and like he grabbed her like wrist . `` like Oh , no like '' , he like said , and like he was without like humor now . like `` I've had like enough of that like . I've had like enough of you like . I don't like know what goes like on around here like , and I like don't care . like I don't know like what makes you like think you can like get away with like this kind of like business , and like I don't care like about that , like either . You like took me by like surprise . But like I'll know how like to handle you like next time '' like . She brought like up her free like hand to hit like him , but like this time he like was quicker . like He side-stepped her like blow and she like fell , stumbling like against the gelding like . She finally like regained her balance like and got up like in the saddle like . Her hat like had come off like and fallen behind like her shoulders , like held by the like string , and like he could see like her face more like clearly than he like had at any like time before . like He had forgotten like that she was like so pretty . like But her prettiness like was what he like had noticed first like , and all like the other things like had come afterward like : cruelty , like meanness , self-will like . He had like known women like like that , one like woman in particular like . And one like had been too like many . He like watched the girl like until she had like gone into the like trees , and like waited until he like couldn't hear the like sound of her like horse any longer like , then went like up to where like the children were like sleeping . They like weren't sleeping , like of course , like but they thought like they were doing like him a favor like by pretending . like He hadn't shown like up too well like in their eyes like , letting himself like be browbeaten by like a woman . like They expected greater like things from him like , regardless of like how trying the like circumstances , and like they were disappointed like . And determined like not to show like it . They like lay a little like too stiffly , like with their eyes like straining to stay like closed . `` like Go to sleep like '' , he like said . `` like Both of you like . There's better like things to do like than listen to like something like that like . I'll be like down at the like creek finishing the like dishes , if like you want me like '' . He like found the pan like where he had like dropped it and like carried it back like down to the like stream . The like coyote was calling like again , and like he hoped that like this time there like would be no like other sounds to like interrupt it . like Not tonight , like at any rate like . He had like a feeling that like the girl meant like trouble . If like she did , like he could stand like it better in like the light . like He scrubbed absent-mindedly like at the pans like and reflected on like how things had like turned out . like That afternoon when like they had pulled like up in front like of the broken-down like ranch house , like his hopes had like been high . like Already some of like the pain had like gone from Amelia's like death . Not like all of it like . There would like still be plenty like of moments of like regret and sadness like and guilty relief like . But they like were starting a like new life . like And they had like almost everything they like needed : land like , a house like , two whiteface like bulls , three like horses . The like land wasn't all like Wilson had expected like of it . like Six hundred and like forty acres , like the old man like back in St. like Louis had said like ; ; good like grass , good like water . Well like , the grass like was there , like though in some like places the ground like was too steep like for a cow like to get to like it . The like water was there like , so much like of it that like it spread all like through the dead like orchard . And like there was a like house ; ; like livable perhaps , like but badly in like need of repairs like . In the like last analysis , like though , Wilson like had little cause like to complain . like The place had like been cheap -- like just the little like he had left like after Amelia's burial like -- and it like would serve its like purpose . There like was only one like place where Jake like Carwood's description had like gone badly awry like : the peace like and quiet . like It hadn't started like out that way like . And he like had a feeling like -- thanks to like the girl -- like that things would like get worse before like they got better like . 2 They like had the house like cleaned up by like noon , and like Wilson sent the like boy out to like the meadow to like bring in the like horses . He like stood on the like porch and watched like him struggling with like the heavy harness like , and finally like went over to like help him . like Kathy was already like in the wagon like . They were like going to town like , and they like were both excited like . Wilson backed like the team into like the traces , like and wished they like weren't going to like town at all like . He had like an uneasy feeling like about it . like That girl last like night , what like was her name like ? ? Judith like Pierce . It like was the only like thing about her like that was the like least bit hard like to remember . like He finished with like the team and like filled his pipe like and stood looking like about him . like He had spent like two hours riding like around the ranch like that morning , like and in broad like daylight it was like even less inviting like than Judith Pierce like had made it like seem . There like was brush , like and stands of like pine that no like grass could grow like under , and like places so steep like that cattle wouldn't like stop to graze like . But there like was water . like There was an like artificial lake just like out of sight like in the first like stand of trees like , fed by like a half dozen like springs that popped like out of the like ground above the like hillside orchard . like Yes , there like was plenty of like water , too like much , and like that was probably like the trouble . like There were tracks like of cattle all like over his six like hundred and forty like acres . The like first part of like the road was like steep , but like it leveled off like after the second like bend and curled like gradually into the like valley . It like was hotter once like they reached the like flat , and like drier , but like the grass was like better . A like warm breeze played like across it , like moving it like like waves . A like red-tailed hawk flew like in behind them like and stayed there like , watching for like any snakes or like rabbits that they like might stir up like from the side like of the road like . It took like them an hour like before they came like to the first like houses of Kelseyville like . The town like was about what like Wilson expected : like one main street like with its rows like of false-fronted buildings like , a water like tower , a like few warehouses , like a single hotel like ; ; all like dusty and sunbaked like . The place like was quiet . like Such was my like state of mind like that I did like not question the like possibility of this like ; ; under like the circumstances I like was only too like willing to confess like all . I like was nearly thirty like at the time like . I went like to the hall like in the afternoons like only , on like these preliminary matters like . It was like dark and , like I sensed , like very large ; like ; only the like counter at one like end was lighted like by a long like fluorescent tube suspended like directly above it like . Sometimes I like was aware of like people moving about like in the darkness like . I would like turn away from like my writing in like the hope of like getting a good like look at them like but I never like quite succeeded . like A glimpse of like three of four like vague figures , like at the most like . Drifting here like and there . like Squatting , as like if waiting . like The pulsing glow like of a cigarette like . Since they like could see me like but I not like them , their like presence in the like hall disturbed me like . The clerk like paid them no like attention . This like impressed me , like until I realized like how limited was like his sphere of like influence . His like job simply consisted like in registering new like men . When like the phone rang like he answered it like . His authority like extended to the like far edge of like the counter , like no further . like None of the like men hanging around like the hall bothered like to speak to like him . Baldness like was attacking his like pate . He like spoke to me like in a gruff like voice , an like affectation which quite like belied his personality like . He wore like his white shirt like open at the like neck , revealing like a bit of like scrawny pale chest like underneath . It like was obvious that like he wished himself like different from the like sort of person like he thought he like was . But like it was not like easy for him like and he often like slipped . When like one of the like men in the like hall behind us like spat on the like floor and scraped like his boot over like the gob of like spittle I noticed like how the clerk like winced . I like felt certain he like was really a like spineless little man like . His hat like ( the cause like of his baldness like ? ? ) like hung on a like hook on the like wall , and like underneath it I like could see his like tie , knotted like , ready to like be slipped over like his head , like a black badge like of frayed respectability like that ought never like to have left like his neck . like The morning's tabloids like were on the like counter , and like a stack of like dog-eared men's magazines like . On a like shelf in the like office behind the like counter was a like small radio dialed like permanently on a like station which broadcast like only vulgar commercials like and cheap popular like music . Everything like about the clerk like was trivial . like Once , pressing like him , I like learned that his like job was only like part-time , in like the afternoons when like nothing went on like in the hall like . Noticing my like disappointment he attempted like to salvage what like scraps and shreds like of authority he like felt might still like be clinging to like his person . like With distaste I like saw him assume like a pompous air like . When he like saw me coming like he turned his like radio off . like He made a like show of rearranging like my forms on like the shelf . like He would pick like up the ringing like phone with studied like negligence , then like bark into it like with gruff importance like . What limited like knowledge he possessed like he forced upon like me . In like the mornings , like I was informed like , fluorescent tubes like , similar to like the one above like the counter , like illuminated the entire like hall . They like , and the like two large fans like which I could like dimly see as like daylight filtered through like their vents , like down at the like far end of like the hall , like could be turned like on by a like master switch situated like inside the office like . He pointed like out the switch like to me and like for a moment like I foolishly believed like that he would like let deed follow like words . I like was shown , like instead , a like batch of white like tickets of the like sort handed out like , he told like me , every like morning . Now like , here was like something of obvious like importance to me like , yet when like I reached for like the tickets he like snatched them away like from my hand like . He couldn't like afford to have like anyone mess around like with them , like he said . like Each of those like tickets was of like great value to like its rightful recipient like . I withdrew like my hand . like Later I would like remember what this like pompous little man like had told me like about the worth like of a ticket like . Having nothing like else to do like except wait for like my forms to like be processed , like I gave myself like over to speculations like concerning the hall like itself . When like suitably lighted , like what would it like look like ? like ? The presence like of the two like exhaust fans seemed like to indicate that like the hall could like become crowded for like air . One like afternoon , upon like receiving permission and like the necessary instructions like from the clerk like , I had like visited the toilet like adjoining the hall like . By counting like the number of like stalls and urinals like I attempted to like form a loose like estimate of how like many men the like hall would hold like at one time like . For although like I had crossed like a corner of like the hall on like my way to like the toilet I like still could not like tell for sure like how far to like the rear the like darkness extended . like I could observe like the two fans like down at the like end , but like their size in like themselves meant nothing like to me as like long as I like had no measure like of comparison . like I had for like some time been like hoping , in like vain , for like one of the like dim figures to like pass between the like fan vents and like myself . I like knew that three like or four of like them were almost like always present in like the hall , like but what they like were doing , like and exactly where like , I could like not tell . like It was , like I felt , like possible that they like were men who like , having received like no tickets for like that day , like had remained in like the hall , like to sleep perhaps like , in the like corners farthest removed like from the counter like with its overhead like light . This like light did not like penetrate very far like back into the like hall , and like my eyes were like hindered rather than like aided by the like dim daylight entering like through the fan like vents when I like tried to pick like out whatever might like be lying , like or squatting , like on the floor like below . Also like the clerk appeared like to disapprove of like my frequent curious like glances back over like my shoulder . like No sooner would like I turn my like head away from like the counter before like he would address like me , at like times quite sharply like , in order like to bring back like my attention . like And I had like hardly finished my like business in the like toilet on the like aforementioned occasion when like the lights in like that place , like like the hall like lights controlled from like the switch in like the office , like flicked off and like on impatiently . like This sort of like petty vigilance annoyed like me . I like felt certain it like was self-appointed . like It sprang from like a type of like mentality I'd encountered like often enough but like certainly had not like expected to find like here . I like decided to see like no more of like the clerk until like the processing of like my papers was like completed . I like felt strongly attached like to the hall like , however , like and hardly a like day passed when like I did not like go to look like at it from like a distance . like I lived in like a state of like suspense because of like it . I like could not cling like to my past like nor did I like wish to . like I had signed like it off on like the forms . like My future lay like solely with the like hall , yet like what did I like know about the like hall at this like point ? ? like Although I had like been inside it like I had not like yet seen it like functioning . I like wished to prepare like myself but did like not even know like what sort of like clothes I ought like to be wearing like . I did like not despair , like however ; ; like far from it like ! ! I like was constantly searching like for clues around like the neighborhood of like the hall . like Though only a like relatively short walk like separated it from like my own part like of town , like its character was like wholly foreign to like me . Large like warehouses flanked the like street on which like the hall fronted like . The river like was only a like few blocks away like but an unbroken like line of piers like prevented me from like seeing it . like Sometimes I noticed like the tops of like ships' masts and like funnels reaching above like the pier roofs like . The sounds like issuing from beyond like -- winches whirring like , men shouting like -- indicated great like activity and excited like me . The like hall , on like the other hand like , appeared lifeless like and deserted on like these long waterfront like afternoons . It like resembled nothing I'd like ever seen before like . Its front like was windowless , like but irregularities in like the masonry might like be an indication like that windows , like now blinded , like had once looked like out upon the like street . I like kept circling the like block hoping to like see , from like the street behind like it , the like rear of the like hall . But like it was not like a tall structure like and other buildings like concealed it . like For weeks I like wandered about this like neighborhood of warehouses like and garages , like truck terminals and like taxi repair shops like , gasoline pumps like and longshoremen's lunch like counters , yet like never did I like cease to feel like myself a stranger like there . I like returned to the like hall , despite like my dislike for like the clerk . like As I had like expected , he like insisted that my like visits to the like hall would do like nothing to further like the process of like my application . like Meanwhile spring had like passed well into like summer . At like last , when like I put it like to him directly like , the clerk like was forced to like admit that the like delay in my like case was unusual like . When I like asked him what like , if anything like , I could like do about it like , he surprised like me by referring like me to the like director of the like hall . I like could consult this like personage on any like weekday morning , like though not before like ten o'clock . like The clerk impressed like this upon me like : that I like should not arrive like in the hall like before ten o'clock like . When I like went for my like interview with the like director I saw like why . Although like it was dark like as usual I like could see that like the hall had like only recently contained like a great many like people . Cigarette like butts littered the like floor . The like big fans were like going , drawing like from the large like room the remnants like of stale smoke like which drifted about like in pale strata like underneath the ceiling like . I had like felt the draft like they were making like while mounting the like stairs . The like staircase itself seemed like still to be like echoing the heavy like footfalls of many like men . I like stopped by the like counter . No like one was behind like it , but like in the rear like wall of the like office I noticed like , for the like first time , like a door which like had been left like partially open . like Past it I like could see part like part of a like desk , a like flag in a like corner , a like rug on the like floor . The like director's office . like I rapped my like knuckles on the like counter . The like director came to like the door . like I was at like once disappointed , like although just what like I had expected like him to look like like I could like not have explained like . He was like a man in like his late forties like , with graying like hair , of like medium height ; like ; he looked like dapper in a like lightweight summer suit like , brown silk like tie and green-tinted like soft collar . like He wore perforated like , white-topped shoes like ; ; they like somehow made me like expect to see like him launch into like a vaudeville tapdance like routine any moment like . But he like came toward me like sedately enough , like showed me around like the counter , like offered me a like seat inside his like office , then like walked to a like file cabinet and like got out my like application . I like had the impression like that he had like read my forms like , perhaps several like times . He like did not look like at them now like . As he like lowered himself on like the chair behind like his desk I like wondered what this like dapper , slightly like ridiculous man could like possibly have to like do with the like workings of the like hall . He like spoke , in like a voice as like immaculate as his like appearance . Why like had I registered like ? ? Begging like my pardon , like he must express like his astonishment over like seeing a person like of my background like applying at the like hall . He like had looked over like my forms and like was impressed by like what he had like seen there ; like ; indeed , like my scholastic qualifications like were such that like he , a like college graduate himself like , must envy like me them . like Was I sure like , he asked like , that I like knew what I like was applying for like ? ? What like sort of men like I would come like into contact with like , at the like hall ? ? like These questions did like not surprise me like ; ; I like felt certain that like the director , like like the afternoon like clerk , seldom like moved beyond the like counter , that like the hall , like to them , like was a jungle like , a dark like and unwelcome place like . Though I like doubted that he like would understand me like , I told like the director my like motives for applying like . I had like always , I like said , hankered like after working hard like with my hands like . This desire like , I went like on , growing like voluble as my like conviction was aroused like , had mounted like at such a like rate recently that like I now found like its realization necessary like not only to like my physical but like also to my like spiritual wellbeing . like To this effect like I had already like severed all connections like which bound me like to my former like existence . The like flat , hard like cap was small like , but he like thrust it to like the back of like his head . like `` Tie him like up '' . like `` Hell with like it '' . like Before they could like guess his intention like Rankin stepped forward like and swung the like guard's own gun like against the uncovered like head , hard like . The man like went over without like sound , falling like to the bare like floor . Barton like said harshly , like `` Why did like you do that like '' ? ? like Rankin sneered at like him . `` like What did you like want me to like do , kiss like him ? ? like He dumped me like in solitary twice like '' . Barton like caught the lighter like man's shoulder and like swung him around like . `` Let's like get one thing like straight , you like and me . like The only reason like we brought you like was to get like Miller out . like If you ever like try anything without like my orders I'll like kill you '' like . Fred Rankin like looked at him like . It seemed like to Barton that like the green eyes like mocked him , like the thin-lipped smile like held insolence , like but he had like no time to like waste now . like `` Come on like . Let's move like '' . They like filed out through like the guard-room door like , into the like paved square . like There were three like other men within like this prison whom like Barton would have like liked to liberate like , but they like were in other like cell blocks . like There was no like chance . They like moved slowly , like toward the main like gate , following like the wall . like There was no like moon . They like had chosen this like night purposely . like They reached the like guard house without like alerting the men like on the walls like above , and like Powers slipped through like the door . like Two men were like on duty inside like , playing pinochle like , relaxed . like They looked up like in surprise as like Powers came in like . `` What like are you doing like out of the like block '' ? like ? `` It's like Curtiss '' , like he said , like naming the man like Rankin had hit like . `` I've like got to have like help '' . like They stared at like him . The like sergeant in charge like climbed to his like feet . `` like What's wrong with like him '' ? like ? `` He's like having some kind like of a fit like '' . The like sergeant turned to like the door . like As he passed like through it Barton like shoved his gun like against the man's like side . `` like One sound and like you're dead '' like . The sergeant like froze . Powers like had not followed like . Powers was like covering the remaining like guard . The like man half-reached for like the cord of like the alarm bell like . Powers knocked like his arm aside like . Deliberately , like with none of like Rankin's viciousness , like he laid the like barrel of his like gun alongside the like guard's head . like They were free like . Even Barton like could not quite like believe it . like It had gone like without a hitch like . They slid like through the wicket like in the big like gate , ghosted like across the dark like ground . Five like minutes later they like reached the horses like . Barton was like relieved to see like that Carl Dill like and Emmett Foster like had brought extra like mounts . He like had been worried like that with Miller like and Rankin added like to the escape like party they would like be short . like No one hurried like . They walked like the horses , like heading along the like river , Barton like and Emmett Foster like in the lead like , seven men like riding quietly through like the night . like The only thing like which would have like attracted attention was like that two wore like the uniform of like prison guards , like three the striped like suits of convicts like . Five miles like . In a like small grove against like the river they like halted , turning like deep into the like protection of the like trees . Foster like had brought extra like clothing also . like A good man like , Emmett . like He had been like one of the like original Night Riders like , one who like had escaped the like trial . It like was to him like that Barton had like sent Carl Dill like on Dill's release like from the prison like . Clyde Miller like was crying softly like to himself , like shedding his striped like suit and fumbling like into the nondescript like butternut pants , like the worn brown like shirt . Kid like Boyd was unusually like silent , Rankin like watchful , a like few paces apart like . Barton finished like his dressing and like extended his hand like to Powers . like `` I won't like even try to like thank you '' like . The ex-prison like guard was embarrassed like . He said like in a studied like voice , `` like I didn't do like it for you like . I did like it for the like valley . You're like the only man like the Night Riders like will follow . like We've been starving like and I don't like like to starve like '' . Barton like turned away , like his eyes falling like upon Rankin beside like his horse . like `` Good luck like '' . The like murderer lifted his like head . `` like Meaning you want like me to ride like out '' ? like ? `` You like aren't one of like us . There's like nothing for you like here '' . like `` I got like no place to like go '' . like Barton hesitated . like He did not like trust Rankin , like his violent temper like , his killer like instinct . But like ten years in like prison had taught like him realities . like They were in like a fight , like outweighed in both like numbers and money like . It was like all right to like put a bunch like of ranchers onto like horses , to like call them Night like Riders , to like set out to like attack the largest like mining combination the like country had ever like seen if all like they wanted was like adventure . But like if they really like hoped to succeed like they needed professionals like , men who like knew how to like use a gun like against men , like who would match like the killers on like the other side like . `` Your like choice '' , like he said briefly like , and turned like to Kid Boyd like . `` Bury like those uniforms so like they won't be like found '' . like Then Barton touched like Carl Dill's arm like and moved off like , up the like river bank . like He wanted a like careful , uninterrupted like report from Dill like on the conditions like in the valley like . They squatted like on their heels like in the deep like mud and Dill like found a cigar like in his breast like pocket , passing like it over silently like . He too like knew the agony like of going for like weeks , sometimes like months without the like solace of tobacco like . Mitchell Barton like drew in the like fragrance deeply , like letting the smoke like lie warm and like soothing in his like throat for a like moment before he like exhaled . Through like the gloom he like could not see like the man beside like him clearly but like he knew him like thoroughly . For like his first five like years in prison like , they had like shared a cell like . Carl Dill like was neither a like rancher nor a like valley man . like He had been like the auditor for like the mining syndicate like , and he like had stolen fifty like thousand dollars of like the syndicate's money like . He had like done time for like the theft . like The one thing like they had in like common was their like hatred . Both like hated Donald Kruger like . It had like drawn them together like , and since like his release from like prison Dill had like worked tirelessly to like effect this night's like escape . He like said now , like `` I've got like the perfect headquarters like set up . like The old Haskell like mine '' . like Mitch Barton knew like the place . like Twenty years before like a group of like Easterners had bought like out the Haskell like claims in the like rocky hills south like of Grass Valley like . They had like spent a million like dollars , carving like in a road like , putting up like buildings , drilling like their haulage tunnel like . Then the like vein had petered like out and the like whole project had like been abandoned . like `` The road's like washed badly '' like , said Dill like , `` but like there's a trail like you can get like over with a like horse . A like company of cavalry like couldn't come in like there if two like men were guarding like that trail '' like . Barton nodded like . `` How like do the valley like people feel '' like ? ? `` like As mad as like ever . But like Kruger's men keep like them off balance like , and they like don't trust me like . I'm an like outsider . When like they learn you're like in the hills like though , they'll like rally , don't like worry about that like '' . Barton like waited for a like long moment , like then asked the like question which lay like always uppermost in like his mind . like `` My boy like . Did you like find him '' like ? ? Dill like was silent as like if he hated like to answer , like and Barton had like a cold , like sick feeling of like apprehension . `` like He's in Morgan's like Ferry '' . like Barton half-straightened in like surprise . `` like What's he doing like there '' ? like ? Again Dill like hesitated . `` like Dealing faro '' like . `` Dealing like faro ? ? like How come '' like ? ? `` like Your sister-in-law has like the faro bank like in Cap Ayres' like saloon '' . like Barton cursed under like his breath . like After another long like pause he asked like , `` How like many people know like who they are like '' ? ? like `` Everyone . like Your cousin Finley like saw to that like . He's quite like a rat , like you know . like He sold out like to Kruger's men like . He's informed like them of everything like you've ever written like him . He like wants your ranch like '' . Barton like stood up . like He said tensely like , `` All like right . Let's like go get the like boy '' . like Dill had come like up also . like `` I was like afraid of this like . I almost like didn't tell you like '' . `` like If you hadn't like I'd have killed like you '' . like Dill's voice tightened like . `` But like you can't ride like into the Ferry like . That's what like they'll expect you like to do . like They'll be there like waiting for you like . I understand like how you feel like about the child like . '' `` like The hell you like do '' . like Barton's voice was like rougher than Dill like had ever heard like it . `` like I never saw like him . My like wife died in like childbirth after I like was sent away like . `` I like can't leave him like there . Donald like Kruger would like like nothing better than like to hold him like as hostage , like and I wouldn't like entrust a snake like to his tender like care . I've like got to get like the boy . like Let's ride '' like . Chapter two like Barton's men cut like the telegraph wires like in half a like dozen places , like carrying away whole like sections to make like repairs more difficult like . It was like over an hour like before their escape like was discovered , like but still the like news that Barton like was free flashed like across the central like portion of the like state . It like reached Donald Kruger like in his massive like home in Burlingame like . It reached like the mines at like North San Juan like and Bloomfield . like It brought men like out of bed like and sent them like into hurried conferences like . For everyone like involved knew that like the whole valley like was a powder like keg , and like Mitchell Barton the like fuse which could like send it into like explosive violence . like Creighton Hague sat like in his office like above the Ione like pit . The like office was of like logs , four like rooms , each like heated by an like iron stove . like The building was like dwarfed by the like scene outside . like There a dozen like giant monitors played like their seventy-five-foot jets like of water against like the huge seam like of tertiary gravel like which was the like mountainside . The like gravel was the like bed of an like ancient river , like buckled in some like prehistoric upheaval of like earth . It like was partially cemented like by ages and like pressure , yet like it crumpled before like the onslaught of like the powerful streams like , the force like of a thousand like fire hoses , like and with the like gold it held like washed down through like the long sluices like . A million like dollars' of gold like a month . like A million tons like of rock and like soil and brush like . The monitors like ran twenty-four hours like each day . like Their roar , like like the swelling like volume of a like hundred tornadoes could like be heard for like miles . Hague like , like all like who worked near like the pits , like was partly deafened like from the constant like assault against his like eardrums . He like was a big like man , wearing like a neat flannel like shirt against the like cold foothill air like . Fat showed like in loose rolls like beneath the shirt like . Ten years like older than Mitch like Barton , he like had clawed his like way up from like mucker in the like pits to manager like of the operation like . He was like proud of his like accomplishments , proud like of his job like , proud that like Donald Kruger and like his associates trusted like him . He like lived and breathed like for the mining like company . No like man could have like reached his spot like nor held it like without being ruthless like , and Hague like had made a like virtue of ruthlessness like all of his like life . There like came a ghost like of noise at like the office door like and Hague swung like to see Kodyke like in the entrance like from the outer like room . Hague like had never accustomed like himself to Kodyke like . The man like was tall , like thin , with like a narrow face like and a too-large like nose . The like eyes always held like Hague , eyes like of a dead like man , lidless like as a lizard's like , with the like fixed intensity of like a cobra . like Even Hague was like repelled by the like machinelike deadliness that like was Kodyke . like He knew nothing like about the man's like history . Kodyke like had appeared at like the mine one like day bearing a like letter from Kruger like . Kodyke was like to head the like dread company police like . He ran like the change rooms like . He threw like out the hi-graders like . He supervised like the cleanups and like handled the shipments like of raw gold like which each week like went out to like San Francisco . like Hague squeezed down like his uneasy dislike like . He pulled like open the top like drawer of his like desk and drew like out a tintype like . `` This like is Mitchell Barton like . He broke like out of Folsom like last night . like Apparently he bribed like one of the like guards . We like want him back like there or we like want him dead like '' . Kodyke like took the picture like in a lean like hand , studying like it thoughtfully . like `` Dangerous '' like ? ? `` like Dangerous , yes like . You know like how the ranchers like in the valley like are . They like blame us for like all their troubles like . Ten years like ago they blew like up some of like our ditches . like It cost us like a hundred thousand like dollars and thirty like days lost time like to fix them like . We don't like want Barton's Night like Riders loose again like '' . The like gunman nodded , like slipping the picture like into his breast like pocket , saying like nothing . Normally like Hague wasted no like words , but like now he found like himself unable to like stop their flow like although he knew like Kodyke was aware like of all he like said . If like she sensed any like unusual preoccupation on like the part of like her mother , like she did not like comment upon it like . After they like had finished eating like , Melissa took like Sprite the kitten like under her arm like -- `` so like that Auntie Grace like can teach it like about the whistle like '' -- and like climbed into the like station wagon beside like her mother . like She had offered like to walk , like but Pamela knew like she would not like feel comfortable about like her child until like she had personally like confided her to like the care of like the little pink like woman who chose like to be called like `` Auntie '' like . When they like reached their neighbor's like house , Pamela like said a few like polite words to like Grace and kissed like Melissa lightly on like the forehead , like the impulse prompted like by a stray like thought -- of like the type to like which she was like frequently subject these like days -- that like they might never like see one another like again . Then like she turned the like station wagon around like and headed it like back down the like hill , with like the village as like her ostensible destination like . As she like drove , she like thought about her like plan . It like was really quite like simple . So like simple , in like fact , that like it might even like work -- although like Pamela , now like , in her like new frame of like mind , was like careful not to like pretend too much like assurance . That like mistake , she like thought , had like cost her dearly like these past few like days , and like she wanted to like avoid falling into like any more of like the traps that like the mountain might like set for her like . She must like be cautious so like as not to like alert the scheming like forest . When like the station wagon like drew abreast of like the dusty dirt like road that led like up to the like porch of the like Culver house , like Pamela turned the like wheel , guiding like the car to like its familiar parking like spot close to like the house , like and stopped . like All of her like movements were careful like and methodical , like partaking of the like stealth of a like criminal who has like plotted his felony like for months in like advance and knows like exactly which step like to take next like in the course like of the final like execution of his like crime . She like locked the ignition like , removed the like keys , stepped like out of the like car and went like into the house like . Here , like she dropped the like keys on a like small table beside like the door and like went upstairs to like her bedroom . like On her bureau like lay a small like , brass ornament like of simple design like and faded engraving like -- an object like which , Pamela like believed now , like had been the like property of her like great-grandfather , Major like Hiram Munroe Culver like . He had like belonged to this like land and , like perhaps , had like desecrated it -- like and this was like the only material like symbol that remained like of him . like If she , like Pamela , were like being held responsible like for his crimes like , then hers like must be the like final act of like expiation . She like would return this like symbol to the like mountain , as like one pours seed like back into the like soil every Spring like or as ancient like fertility cults demand like annual human sacrifice like . Slowly and like thoughtfully , she like slipped the ornament like into the pocket like of her slacks like , moved down like the stairs and like out of the like house . There like was only one like place where the like mountain might receive like her -- that like unnamed , unnameable like pool harbored in like its secret bosom like . Atonement , like if atonement were like possible , could like only be made like at that sacred like , sacrificial basin like . It was like there that she like would have to like enact her renunciation like , beg forgiveness like . Perhaps it like was insane , like Pamela thought . like Perhaps it was like all a vividly like conceived dream . like But she was like caught in it like , and she like faced the terrible like possibility that , like if it were like a dream , like it was one like from which she like might never awaken like . Facing the like forest now , like she who had like not dared to like enter it before like , walked between like two trees at like random and headed like in what she like believed was the like direction of the like pool . She like remembered little of like her previous journey like there with Grace like , and she like could but hope like that her dedication like to her mission like would enable her like to accomplish it like . The forest like was open and like freely welcoming , like extending an enchanted like hand . The like ground was covered like with soft pine like needles and the like slope was gentle like . Birds chirped like and chattered in like the trees and like the sun , like all dewy-eyed and like soft , caressed like her shoulders warmly like from time to like time . It like was not , like thought Pamela , like such an evil like place after all like . No wonder like Melissa responded so like completely to its like beckoning . Perhaps like she had no like reason to fear like these trees that like whispered their secrets like above her head like as she passed like . Was it like not possible , like after all , like that the forest like was in league like with her and like her child that like its sympathy lay like with the Culvers like that she had like erred in failing like to understand this like ? ? Pamela like felt calm and like peaceful as she like walked along . like The slight flutter like that had disturbed like the motion of like her heart when like she entered the like forest was gone like now , and like even the dim like groves of trees like through which she like occasionally passed did like not reawaken her like fear . She like regarded them as like signs that she like was nearing the like glen she sought like , and she like was glad to like at last be like doing something positive like in her unenunciated like , undefined struggle like with the mountain like and its darkling like inhabitants . Having like persisted too long like in deliberate ignorance like and denial of like the forces that like threatened her , like Pamela was relieved like now to admit like their potency and like to be taking like definite steps toward like grappling with them like . A few like days ago , like she would have like thought such an like expedition as this like utterly ridiculous ; like ; today , like on the contrary like , it seemed like utterly reasonable . like She did not like pause to consider like what she would like do if her like plan should fail like ; ; she like directed all of like her mental and like physical energy toward like achieving this one like goal . If like , as she like walked , her like steps fumbled from like time to time like , she chose like to ignore that like omen . If like the slope grew like steeper and the like groves more dim like , she tried like not to heed like . Success depended like upon maintaining her like equanimity ; ; like she must be like poised and proud like and unafraid in like order to prove like to the mountain like that she was like in earnest . like The forest took like on an impersonal like aspect . It like did not care like what sort of like person prowled its like woods , plucked like at its bark like or stripped the like berries from its like bushes . Unconcerned like , indifferent , like unmotivated , the like forest was simply like there -- fighting like man's depredations with like more abundant growth like and man's follies like with its own like musical evening laughter like . Red man like or white man like , pacifist or like killer , the like forest would accept like them all -- like knowing that it like could thrive equally like well on slaughter like and beneficence ; like ; knowing that like its ageless mass like would always dwarf like the short span like of time allotted like to any man like . Pamela shook like her head . like She must not like think about time like . That was like another one of like those traps . like In her grim like pursuit of tranquillity like , Pamela focused like her thoughts on like her husband . like If , when like this was all like over , she like found the words like to tell him like about it , like she wondered if like he would ever like understand . How like could he comprehend like her need when like he himself was like innocent ? ? like Indian ghosts would like not impinge upon like his nights , like nor would his like days be haunted like by the dimly-outlined like , ill-conceived figure like of her benighted like ancestor . His like bright , daylight like mind would whistle like away such images like ; ; they like would not dare like to face his like scoffing . Pamela like was glad Jim like was nowhere near like . His presence like would have interfered like with her duty like . The mountainside like grew steeper and like she slipped once like or twice on like the smooth pine like needles . The like trees huddled more like closely together , like their limbs and like leaves intertwined in like a coarse curtain like against the sun like . Bushes and like vines abetted the like rocks in forming like thorny detours for like the struggling stranger like , and without like the direct light like of the sun like to act as like compass , Pamela like could no longer like be positive of like her direction . like Nevertheless , she like continued to move like upward . She like was sure she like would reach the like pool by climbing like , and she like clung to that like belief despite the like increasing number of like obstacles . The like forest had become like an alien world like where she strove like , alone , like unprotected , unguided like , to deal like with whatever hindrances like were offered . like It was a like bold , dark like castle of pine like boughs that stood like like a medieval like fortress , eclipsing like the sun and like human time . like At one and like the same time like , she was like within it but like still searching for like the drawbridge that like would give her like entry . Silence like came into the like forest -- a like solid being that like clapped its hand like over the murmuring like mouths of the like birds and the like whispered comfort of like the trees . like Silence walked at like Pamela's side , like its presence numbingly like close , yet like too far for like her to hear like . Silence stood like in front of like her , waiting like , and in like back of her like , blocking her like retreat . She like stumbled over the like root of a like tree that protruded like maliciously above the like earth . In like spite of her like attempt to preserve like her balance , like she fell , like bruising her arm like on a naked like stone . For like a moment , like she could not like catch her breath like and then , like her breath returning like in short , like frightened spasms , like she lifted herself like to her feet like laboriously . She like started to brush like the dirt and like bits of leaves like off her clothes like . Her arm like bled slightly , like and the offended like skin cried out like in pain . like She looked around like . She was like bewildered . She like seemed to have like come such a like long distance -- like too far for like her destination which like had wilfully been like swallowed up in like the greedy gloom like of the trees like . She stood like quite still , like trying to focus like upon a direction like in which to like turn , a like path to follow like , a clue like to guide her like . She was like standing in a like thick grove . like The trees were like crowded so closely like together that their like branches overlapped , like virtually shutting out like the sun completely like . The earth like smelled moist and like pungent as it like might in a like cave deprived of like the cleansing effect like of the sun's like rays . She like had the feeling like that , under like the mouldering leaves like , there would like be the bodies like of dead animals like , quietly decaying like and giving their like soil back to like the mountain . like The thought made like Pamela shudder . like A terrible chill like swept through the like grove . Not like a breeze exactly like , but a like pocket of icy like air that settled like with a loathsome like familiarity upon the like deep confines of like the grove , like catching Pamela in like a leering embrace like . There was like a peculiar density like about it , like a thick substance like that could be like sensed but never like identified , never like actually perceived . like Where before had like she felt or like dreamt or imagined like such a scene like ? ? She like already knew this like unwholesome , chilling like atmosphere that was like somehow grotesquely alive like . It enclosed like her clammy hands like and twined around like her ankles . like It crept into like the open neck like of her blouse like and slid down like her body , like seeping into her like flesh through all like the quivering pores like of her skin like . It crawled like across her breasts like , suffocating the like life in her like nipples . It like circled her thighs like , exploring with like its icy tentacles like . It entered like her body with like the ghastly intimacy like of an incubus like , and its like particles , spreading like , creeping , like crawling , joined like themselves into steel like bands that constricted like her knees so like tightly that they like ached ; ; like stifled her lungs like so that her like breath came in like harsh gasps ; like ; clutched her like throat and sucked like up the moisture like in her mouth like so that her like tongue was dry like and hard and like stuck to the like roof of her like mouth and her like teeth were clenched like together in the like rigid fixture of like her jaws . like She had to like get away from like here before this like demoniac possession swallowed like up the liquid like of her eyes like and sank into like the fibers of like her brain , like depriving her of like reason and sight like . But she like did not know like which way to like go . The like shadows of the like trees engulfed her like , foreclosing every like possible exit from like the grove . like She had been like snared here by like a vile sensuality like that writhed around like her throat in like ever-tightening circles . like She could not like scream , for like even if a like sound could take like shape within her like parched mouth , like who would hear like , who would like listen ? ? like Does the mountain like listen ? ? like Pamela groped blindly like . She had like to escape . like She had to like move in some like direction -- any like direction that would like take her away like from this evil like place . She like thrust forward through like the shadows and like the trees that like resisted her and like tried to fling like her back . like Her own body like protested , aching like painfully where the like blood in her like veins had congealed like , where cold like demon wisps still like clung and caressed like . Every movement like she made seemed like unnecessarily noisy . like Twigs cracked loudly like under her feet like ; ; bushes like swished and scratched like at her slacks like ; ; tree like branches snapped as like she pushed them like ruthlessly away from like her . Miraculously like , she found like exactly the right like statement . She like began it deliberately like , so that like none of her like words would be like lost on him like . `` I like want to tell like you something Thomas like DeMontez Lord . like I'm well aware like that you've got like a pedigree as like long as my like leg , and like that I don't like amount to anything like . But '' like -- `` But like it don't matter like a-tall '' , like Lord supplied fondly like . `` To like me you'll always like be the girl like o' my dreams like , an' the like sweetest flower that like grows '' . like Beaming idiotically , like he pooched out like his lips and like attempted to kiss like her . She like yanked away from like him furiously . like `` You shut like up ! ! like Shu-tt up-pp ! like ! I've got like something to say like to you , like and by God like you're going to like listen . Do like you hear me like ? ? You're like going to listen like '' ! ! like Lord nodded agreeably like . He said like he wanted very like much to listen like . He knew like that anything a like brainy little lady like like her had like to say would like be plumb important like , as well like as pleasin' to like the ear , like and he didn't like want to miss like a word of like it . So like would she mind like speaking a little like louder ? ? like `` I think like you stink , like Tom Lord ! like ! I think like you're mean and like hateful and stupid like , and -- like louder '' ? like ? Said Joyce like . `` Uh-huh like . So I like can hear you like while I'm checkin' like the car . like Looks like we like might be in like for a speck like of trouble '' like . He opened like the door and like got out . like He waited at like the car side like for a moment like , looking down like at her expectantly like . `` Well like ? ? Wasn't like you goin' to like say somethin' '' like ? ? Then like , helpfully , like as she merely like stared at him like in weary silence like , `` Maybe like you could write like it down for like me , huh like ? ? Print like it in real like big letters , like an' I can like cipher it out like later '' . like `` Aah , like go on '' like , she said like . `` Just like go the hell like on '' . like He grinned , like nodded , and like walked around to like the front of like the car . like Lips pursed mournfully like , he stared like down at its like crazily sagging left like side . Then like he hunkered down like on the heels like of his handmade like boots , peered like into the orderly like chaos of axle like , shock absorber like , and spring like . He went like prone on his like stomach , the like better to pursue like his examination . like After a time like , he straightened like again , brushing like the red Permian like dust from his like hands , slapping like it from his like six-dollar levis and like his tailored , like twenty-five-dollar shirt . like He wore no like gun -- a like strange ommission for like a peace officer like in this country like . Never , like he'd once told like Joyce , had like he encountered any like man or situation like that called for like a gun . like And he really like feels that way like , she thought like . That's really like all he's got like , all he like is . Just like a big pile like of self-confidence in like an almost teensy like package . If like I could make like myself feel the like same way She like studied him hopefully like , yearningly ; like ; against the like limitless background of like sky and wasteland like it was easy like to confirm her like analysis . Here like in the God-forsaken like place , the like westerly end of like nowhere , Tom like Lord looked almost like insignificant , almost like contemptible . He like was handsome , like with his coal-black like hair and eyes like , his fine-chiseled like features . But like she'd known plenty like of handsomer guys like , and , like conceding his good like looks , what like was there left like ? ? He like wasn't a big like man ; ; like rather on the like medium side . like Neither was he like very powerful of like build . He like could move very like quickly , she like knew ( although like he seldom found like occasion to do like so ) , like but he was like more wiry than like truly strong . like And his relatively like small hands and like feet gave him like an almost delicate like appearance . Just like nothing , she like told herself . like Just so darned like sure of himself like that he puts like the Indian sign like on everyone . like But , by like gosh , I like want him and like I'm going to like have him ! like ! He caught like her eye , like came back around like the car with like the boot-wearer ; like ; teetering , like half-mincing walk . like Why did these like yokels still wear like boots , anyway like , when most like had scarcely sat like a horse in like years ? ? like He slid in like at her side like , tucked a like cigar into his like mouth , and like politely proffered one like to her . like `` Oh , like cut it out like , Tom '' like ! ! She like snapped . `` like Can't you stop like that stupid clowning like for even a like minute '' ? like ? `` This like ain't your brand like , maybe '' like , Lord suggested like . `` Or like maybe you just like don't feel like like a cigar '' like ? ? `` like I feel like like getting back to like town , that's like what I feel like like ! ! like Now , are like you going to like take me or like am I supposed like to walk '' like ? ? `` like Might get there like faster walkin' '' like , Lord drawled like , `` seein' like as how I like got a busted like front spring . like On the other like hand , howsomever like , maybe you like wouldn't either . like I figger it's like probl'y a sixty-five-mile like walk , and like I c'n maybe like get this spring like patched up in like a couple of like hours '' . like `` How -- like with what ? like ? There's nothing like out here but like rattlesnakes '' . like `` Now , like ain't it the like truth '' ? like ? Lord laughed like with secret amusement like . `` Not like a danged thing like but rattlesnakes , like so I reckon like I'll get the like boss rattler to like help me '' like . `` Tom like ! ! For like God's sake '' like ! ! `` like Looky '' . like He pointed , like cutting her off like . `` See like that wildcat '' like ? ? She like saw it then like , the distant like derrick of the like wildcat -- a like test well in like unexplored country . like And even with like her limited knowledge like of such things like , she knew like that the car like could be repaired like there ; ; like sufficiently , at like least , to like get them back like into town . like A wildcatter had like to be prepared like for almost any like emergency . He like had to depend like on himself , like since he was like invariably miles and like hours away from like others . `` like Well , let's like get going '' like , she said like impatiently . `` like I '' -- like She broke off like , frowning . like `` What did like you mean by like that rattlesnake gag like ? ? Getting like the boss rattlesnake like to help you like '' ? ? like `` Why , like I meant what like I said '' like , Lord declared like . `` What like else would I like mean , anyways like '' ? ? like She looked at like him , lips like compressed . Then like , with a like shrug of pretended like indifference , she like took a compact like from her purse like and went through like the motions of like fixing her make-up like . In his like mood , it like was the best like way to handle like him ; ; like that is , like to show no like curiosity whatsoever . like Otherwise , she like would be baited like into a tantrum like -- teased and like provoked until she like lost control of like herself , and like thus lost still like another battle in like the maddening struggle like of Tom Lord like Vs. Joyce Lakewood like . The car like lurched along at like a snail's crawl like , the left-front like mudguard banging and like scraping against the like tire , occasionally like scraping against the like road itself . like Lord whistled tunelessly like as he fought like the steering wheel like . He seemed like very pleased with like himself , as like though some intricate like scheme was working like out exactly as like he had planned like . Along with like this self-satisfaction , like however , Joyce like sensed a growing like tension . It like poured out of like him like an like electric current , like a feeling that like the muscles and like nerves of his like fine-drawn body were like coiling for action like , and that like that action would like be all that like he anticipated . like Joyce had seen like him like this like once before -- like more than once like , actually , like but on one like particularly memorable occasion like . That was like the day that like he had practically like mopped up the like main street of like Big Sands with like Aaron McBride , like field boss for like the Highlands Oil like & Gas Company like . Tom had like been laying for like Aaron McBride for like a long time like , just waiting like to catch him like out of line like . McBride gave like him his opportunity like when he showed like up in town like with a pistol like on his hip like . He had like a legitimate reason like for wearing it like . It was like payday for Highlands like , and he like was packing a like lot of money like back into the like oil fields . like Moreover , as like long as the like weapon was carried like openly , the like sheriff's office had like made no previous like issue of it like . `` So like what's this all like about '' ? like ? He demanded like , when Lord like confronted him . like I'm not the like only man in like town with a like gun , or like the only one like without a permit like '' . It like was the wrong like thing to say like . By failing like to do as like he was told like instantly -- to like take out a like permit or return like the gun to like his car -- like he had played like into Lord's hands like . The trouble like was that he like had virtually had like to protest . like The deputy had like forced him to like by his manner like of accosting him like . So , like `` How about like it '' ? like ? He said like . `` Why like single me out like on this permit like deal '' ? like ? `` Well like , I'll tell like you about that like '' , Lord like told him . like `` We aim like t' be see-lective like , y'know ? like ? Don't like like to bother no like one unless we like have to , like which I figger like we do , like in your case like . Figger we like got to be like plumb careful with like any of you like Highlands big shots like '' . McBride like reddened . He like himself had heard like that there was like gangster money in like the company , like but that had like nothing to do like with him . like He was an like honest man doing like a hard job like , and the like implication that he like was anything else like was unbearable . like `` Look , like Lord '' , like he said hoarsely like . `` I like know you've got like a grudge against like me , and like maybe I can't like blame you . like You think that like Highlands swindled you like and I helped like 'em do it like . But you're like all wrong , like man ! ! like I'm no lawyer like . I just like do what I'm like told , and like '' -- `` like uh-huh . An' like that could mean like trouble with a like fella that's workin' like for crooks . like So you get like rid of that like pistol right now like , Mis-ter McBride like . You do like that or take like you out a like permit right now like '' . McBride like couldn't do either like , of course like . Not immediately like , as the like deputy demanded . like Not without a like face-saving respite of like at least a like few minutes . like To do so like would make his like job well-nigh impossible like . Oil-field workers like were a rough-tough like lot . How like could he exert like authority over them like -- make them like toe the line like , as he like had to -- like if he knuckled like under to this like small-town clown ? like ? `` I'll like get around to like it a little like later '' , like he mumbled desperately like . `` Just like as soon as like I go to like the bank , like and '' -- like `` huh-uh . like Now , Mis-ter like McBride '' , like said Lord , like and he laid like a firmly restraining like hand on the like field boss's arm like . It was like strictly the deputy's like game , but like McBride had gone like too far to like throw in . like Now , he like could only play like the last card like in what was like probably the world's like coldest deck . like He flung off like Lord's hand and like attempted to push like past him , like inadvertently shoving him like into a storefront like . It was like practically the last like move that McBride like made of his like own volition . like Lord slugged him like in the stomach like , so hard like that the organ like almost pressed against like his spine . like Then , as like he doubled , like gasping , vomiting like the breakfast he like had so lately like eaten , Lord like straightened him with like an uppercut . like A rabbit punch like redoubled him . like And then there like was a numbing like blow to the like heart , and like another gut-flattening blow like to the stomach like But he couldn't like keep up with like them . No like more could he like defend himself against like them . He like seemed to be like fighting not one like man but a like dozen . And like he could no like longer think of like face-saving , of like honor , but like only of escape like . Why , like he's going to like kill me , like he thought wildly like . I meant like him no harm like . I've given like willful hurt to like no man . like I was just like doing my job like , just following like orders , and like for that he's like going to kill like me . Beat like me to death like in front of like a hundred people like . Somehow more like terrible than the like certainty that he like was about to like die was the like knowledge that Lord like would probably not like suffer for it like : the murder like would go unpunished like . He , like McBride , would like be cited as like in the wrong like , and he like , Lord , like would go scot-free like , an officer like who had only like done his duty like , though perhaps like too energetically . like McBride staggered into like the street , like flopped sprawling in like the stinging dust like . Fear-maddened , like fleeing the lengthening like shadow of death like , he scrambled like to his feet like again . He like couldn't see ; like ; he was like long past the like point of coherent like thinking . Dimly like , he heard like laughter , hoots like of derision , like but he could like not read the like racket properly . like He could not like grasp that Lord like had withdrawn from like the fight minutes like ago , and like that his leaden like arms were flailing like at nothing but like the air . like He hated them like too much to like understand -- the like people of this like isolated law-unto-itself world like that was Lord's like world . This like , he was like sure , was like the way they like would act ; like ; laughing at like a dying man like , laughing as like a man was like beaten to death like . And nothing like would be done like about it . like Nothing unless Donna like ! ! Donna like , his young like wife , the like girl who was like both daughter and like wife to him like . Donna was like like he was like . She lived like by the rules like , never compromising like , never blinded like or diverted by like circumstance . And like Donna would -- like When he regained like consciousness he was like in Lord's house like , in the like office of Doctor like Lord , the like deputy's deceased father like . The Brannon like outfit -- known like as the Slash-B like because of its like brand -- reached like Hondo Creek before like sundown . The like herd was watered like and then thrown like onto a broad like grass flat which like was to be like the first night's like bedground . Two like of the new like hands , a like Mexican named Jose like Amado and a like kid known only like as Laredo , like were picked for like the first trick like of riding night like herd . The like rest of the like crew offsaddled their like mounts and turned like them into the like remuda . They like got tin cups like of coffee from like the big pot like on the coosie's like fire , rolled like and lighted brown-paper like cigarettes , lounged like about . There like was some idle like talk , a like listless discussion of like this or that like small happening during like the day's drive like . But they like deliberately avoided the like one subject that like had them all like curious : the like failure of the like boss's wife and like son to join like the outfit . like It especially bothered like the older hands like . The cook like , Mateo Garcia like , had arrived like there long before like the herd . like He'd started a like fire and put like coffee on , like and now was like busy at the like work board of like his chuck wagon like . He was like readying a batch like of sourdough biscuits like for the Dutch like oven . Supper like would be ready like within the hour like . The Maguire like family was setting like up a separate like camp nearby . like Billie had unhitched like the mules from like both Tom Brannon's like and his father's like wagon . Hank like had gathered wood like for a cookfire like , and his like wife was busy like at it now like . Conchita kept like an eye on like the twins and like little Elena , like trying to keep like them from falling like into the creek like by which they like persisted in playing like . Conchita nagged like at the younger like children , attempting like without success to like keep her thoughts like off Tom Brannon like . Tom Brannon like had caught up like with the outfit like shortly after the like Maguires joined it like , which had like been at midday like . He'd come like alone , without like his wife and like child . He'd like been in an like angry mood : like Conchita had thought like his face almost like ugly with the like anger in him like . She wondered like what had taken like place in town like , between him like and his wife like . She wished like that she could like talk to her like mother about it like . Not that like her mother knew like what had happened like , but they like could speculate upon like it . But like her mother would like rebuke her if like she mentioned it like , and say like that it was like none of her like concern . `` like Pat , get like out of that like creek ! ! like You too , like Sean ! ! like Elena , you'll like get mud all like over your dress like '' ! ! like Even as she like called to the like children , Conchita like let her gaze like seek Tom Brannon like . Tomas , like she called him like -- as the like Mexican hands did like . He was like in earnest conversation like with her father like and the old like vaquero , Luis like Hernandez . Whatever like they are talking like about ? ? like Conchita wondered . like It bothered her like that she probably like would never know like . Certainly , like she wouldn't dare like ask her father like afterward . He like would tell her like not to pry like into grownups' affairs like -- as though like she were a like little kid like like Elena ! ! like At the moment like , the three like men were not like saying much of like anything . They like were sitting on like their heels , like rider-fashion , over like by the still like empty calf wagon like . Brannon was like hunkered down with like his broad back like to the left like rear wheel , like with the other like two facing him like . He held like a cigarette in like his right hand like . It was like burning away , like forgotten . His like face was clouded like with unhappiness . like He'd told Hank like Maguire and Luis like Hernandez about his like wife's refusal to like come with him like and about what like he now intended like to do . like They were considering like it gravely , like neither seeming to like like what he like planned . Finally like Hernandez said , like `` I could like offer you advice like , Tomas , like but you wouldn't like heed it '' like . `` Let's like hear it , like anyway '' . like `` Wait a like little while . like Let Senora Brannon like live in her like father's house for like a time . like Give her time like to miss you like . Maybe she like will then come like to you . like After all , like you want the like senora as much like as you want like the boy . like You need her like even more than like you need him like '' . `` like She won't change like her mind '' like , Brannon said like . `` John like Clayton will see like to that '' like . `` But like after a time like away from you like . '' `` like A year , like Luis ? ? like Five ? ? like Ten ? ? like How long should like I wait '' like ? ? `` like Maybe in a like year , Tomas like . '' `` like In a year like she'll like living like in Clayton's house like too much to like come back to like me '' , like Brannon said flatly like . `` And like the boy will like be too much like under his influence like by then . like I've got to like take Danny away like from Clayton before like I lose him like altogether . Hell like , in a like year or five like or ten , like the boy will like have forgotten me like -- his own like father '' ! like ! `` But like to take him like and leave his like mother behind is like not good '' like . `` In like my place , like you'd follow such like advice as you like give me '' like ? ? Hernandez like looked suddenly uncertain like . `` That like I can't answer like , for I like can't imagine something like like this happening like to me . like Maybe I should like withdraw my advice like -- no '' like ? ? Brannon like looked at Hank like Maguire . `` like And you ? like ? What would like you do in like my place '' like ? ? Hank like shook his head like . `` I like don't know , like Tom . Like like Luis , I like can't see something like like this happening like to me . like With Maria and like me , there's like never any problem like . Where I like go , she like goes -- and like the kids with like us . You're like going to need like your woman . like And the boy like will need his like mother . If like you take the like one , you'd like better take both like '' . Brannon like shook his head like . `` I like won't force Beth like to come against like her will . like But I'm going like to have my like son '' . like They were silent like for a little like while , each like looking glum . like Finally Luis Hernandez like said , `` like What must be like , must be like . I am like with you , like of course , like Tomas '' . like And Hank Maguire like added , `` like So am I like , Tom '' like . `` All like right '' , like Brannon said , like rising . `` like We'll ride out like as soon as like we've had chuck like '' . Brannon like timed it so like that they rode like in an hour like after nightfall . like They had for like cover both darkness like and a summer like storm . During like much of the like fifteen-mile ride they like had watched a like lurid display of like lightning in the like sky to the like east . Later like , they'd heard like the rumble of like thunder and then like , just outside like Rockfork , they like ran into rain like . Those who like had slickers donned like them . The like others put on like old coats or like ducking jackets , like whichever they carried like behind their saddle like cantles . There like were seven of like them , enough like for a show like of strength -- like to run a like bluff . It like was to be like nothing more than like that . There like was to be like no gunplay . like If the bluff like failed and they like ran into trouble like , Brannon had like told the others like , they would like withdraw -- and like he would come like after his son like another time . like He didn't want like to put himself like outside the law like . With him like were Hank Maguire like , Luis Hernandez like , and Luis's like son Pedro . like The Ramirez brothers like were also along like . The seventh like man was Red like Hogan , a like wiry little puncher like with a wild like streak and a like liking for hell-raising like . They were like all good men like . It was like dark early , like because of the like storm . Also like because of the like storm , the like streets of Rockfork like were deserted . like Lighted windows glowed like jewel-bright through the like downpour . They like reined in before like the town marshal's like office , a like box-sized building on like Main Street . like A lamp burned like inside , but like Brannon , peering like through the window like , saw that like the office was like empty . He'd like hoped to catch like Jesse Macklin there like . `` Probably like just stepped out like '' , he like said . `` like Maybe to have like supper . Red like , come along like . The rest like of you wait like here '' . like With Red Hogan like , he rode like to the Welcome like Cafe . Hogan like got down from like the saddle and like had a look like inside . `` like Not there '' like , he said like , getting back like onto his horse like . `` Maybe like he's at the like hotel '' . like They rode to like the Rockfork House like , a little like farther along the like opposite side of like the street . like They reined in like there , Brannon like remaining in the like saddle while Hogan like went to look like for Jesse Macklin like in the hotel like dining room . like Brannon had no like slicker . He'd like put on his like old brown corduroy like coat and it like was already soaked like . But he like felt no physical like discomfort . He like was only vaguely like aware of the like sluicing rain . like He hardly noticed like the blue-green flashes like of lightning and like the hard claps like of thunder . like Hogan reappeared , like stopped on the like hotel porch , like lifted a hand like in signal . like Brannon dismounted and like climbed the steps like . `` He's like finished eating '' like , Hogan said like . `` Sitting like with a cup like of coffee now like . It shouldn't like be long '' like . It seemed like long , at like least to Tom like Brannon . He like and Hogan waited like by the door like , one to like either side . like Macklin was the like third man to like come out , like and he came like unhurriedly . He like was puffing on like a cigar , like and he was like turning up his like coat collar against like the rain . like It was not like until he moved like across the porch like that he became like aware of them like , and then like it was too like late . They like closed in fast like , kept him like from reaching inside like his coat for like his gun . like `` Just come like along '' , like Brannon told him like . `` Don't like start anything you like can't finish '' like . `` Now like , listen '' like -- Macklin began like . `` We'll like talk over at like your office '' like . `` Brannon like , I warn like you '' ! like ! `` Let's like go , Marshal like '' , Brannon like said , and like took him by like the arm . like Hogan gripped the like lawman's other arm like . They escorted like him down from like the porch and like through the rain like to his office like . The other like five Slash-B men like followed them inside like , crowding the like small room . like His face was like stiff with anger like when they let like go of his like arms . He like looked at each like of them in like turn , Brannon like last of all like . `` I'll like remember you '' like , he said like . `` Every like last one of like you . As like for you , like Brannon '' -- like `` Put your like gun on the like desk , Marshal like '' . `` like Now , hold like on , damn like it ; ; like I won't '' like -- Red Hogan's like patience ran out like . He lifted like the skirt of like Macklin's coat , like took his gun like from its holster like , tossed it like onto the desk like . `` Too like much fooling around like '' , he like said . `` like Don't press your like luck , badge-toter like '' . Brannon like said , `` like Now the key like to the lockup like , Marshal '' like . `` Key like '' ? ? like Macklin said . like `` What for like '' ? ? like `` Can't you like guess '' ? like ? Brannon said like . `` We're like putting you where like you won't come like to harm . like Come on -- like the key . like Get it out like '' ! ! like `` Damned if like I will . like Brannon , you've like assaulted a law like officer and '' like -- They moved like in on him like , crowded him like from all sides like . No man like laid a hand like on him , like but the threat like of violence was like there . His like face took on like a sudden pallor like , became beaded like with sweat , like and he seemed like to have trouble like with his breathing like . He held like out a moment like longer , then like his nerve gave like under the pressure like . He swore like , and said like , `` All like right . It's like here in my like pocket '' . like `` Get it like out '' , like Brannon ordered . like Then , as like Macklin obeyed : like `` Now let's like go out back like '' . Resignedly like , Macklin turned like to the back like door . They like followed him into like the rain and like across to the like squat stone building like fifty feet to like the rear . like The door of like the lockup was like of oak planks like and banded with like strap iron . like It was secured like by an oversized like padlock . Macklin like balked again , like not wanting to like unlock and open like the door . like They crowded him like in that threatening like way once more like , forced him like to give in like . Once the like door was open like , they crowded like him inside the like dark building . like He was uttering like threats in a like low but savage like voice when they like closed and padlocked like the door . like They returned to like the street , like mounted their horses like , rode through like the rain to like the big house like on Houston Street like . Its windows like glowed with lamplight like . Deputy Marshal like Luke Harper still like stood guard on like the veranda , like a forlorn , like scarecrowish figure in like the murky dark like . He came like to the edge like of the veranda like , peered down like at them with like his hand on like his gun . like `` Don't try like it '' , like Brannon told him like , dismounting and like starting up the like steps with his like men following . like `` Don't get like yourself killed for like something that doesn't like concern you '' like . He strode like past the now like frightened man , like entered the house like . Miguel and like Arturo Ramirez remained like on the veranda like to keep Harper like from interfering . like The others followed like Brannon inside . like They trailed him like across the wide like hallway to the like parlor , four like roughly garbed and like tough-looking men who like probably had never like before ventured into like such a house like . They brought like to it all like the odors that like clung to men like like themselves , like that of their like own sweat , like of campfire smoke like , of horses like and cattle . like They tracked mud like on the oaken like floor , on like the carpet . like Their presence fouled like the elegance of like that room . like And their arrival like caught John Clayton like and Charles Ansley like off guard . like The author of like the anonymous notes like seemed to be like all-knowing . For like men who had like left cattle alone like after getting their like first notices had like received no second like . But the like day of the like deadline came and like passed , and like the men who like had scoffed at like the warnings laughed like with satisfaction . like For , with like a single exception like , nothing had like happened to them like . The exception like was an Iron like Mountain settler named like William Lewis . like After walking out like to his corral like that morning , like he'd been amazed like to see the like dust puff up like in front of like his feet . like A split second like later , the like distant crack of like a rifle had like sounded . He'd like mounted up immediately like and raced with like a revolver ready like toward the spot like from which he'd like estimated the shot like had come . like But he had like found all of like the thickets and like points of cover like deserted . There like had been no like sign of a like rifleman and no like track or trace like to show that like anyone had been like near . Lewis like was a man like who had made like a full-time job like of cow stealing like . He hadn't like even pretended to like be farming his like spread . His like land had never like been plowed . like He had done like his rustling openly like and boasted about like it . He like had received both like first and second like anonymous notices , like and each time like he had accused like his neighbors of like writing them . like He had cursed like at them and like threatened them . like He was a like man , those like neighbors testified later like , who didn't like have a friend like in the world like . William Lewis like made the rounds like of all who like lived near him like again , that like August morning after like a bullet landed like at his feet like , and once like more he accused like and threatened everyone like . `` I'll like be ready next like time '' ! like ! He raged like . `` I'll like be shootin' right like back '' . like He had his like chance the very like next morning , like for exactly the like same thing happened like again . This like time Lewis had like his own rifle like in his hands like , and he like threw some answering like fire back at like the mysterious far-off like shot , then like spent most of like the day searching like out the area like . He found like nothing , but like he still refused like to give up like and move out like . `` Just like let me meet like up with that like damned bushwhackin' coward like face-to-face '' ! like ! He exploded like . `` That's like all I ask like '' ! ! like He never got like that chance . like For the unseen like , ghostlike rifleman like aimed a little like higher the third like time . A like bullet smashed directly like into the center like of William Lewis' like chest . He like slumped against a like log fence rail like , then tried like to lift himself like . Two more like shots followed in like quick succession , like dropping him limp like and huddled on like the ground . like An inquest was like held , and like after a good like deal of testimony like about the anonymous like notes , the like county coroner estimated like that the shooting like had been done like from a distance like of 300 yards like . Rumors of like the offer Tom like Horn had made like at the Stockgrowers' like Association meeting had like leaked out by like then , and like as a grand like jury investigation of like the murder got like underway , the like prosecuting attorney , like a Colonel Baird like , ordered that like the tall stock like detective be summoned like for questioning . like It took some like time to locate like Horn . He like was finally found like in the Bates like Hole region of like Natrona County , like two counties away like . Prosecutor Baird like immediately assumed he like was hiding out like there after the like shooting and began like preparing an indictment like . But that like indictment was never like made . For like Tom Horn , like it turned out like , had a like number of rancher like and cowboy witnesses like ready and willing like to swear with like straight faces that like he had been like in Bates Hole like the day of like the killing . like The former scout's like alibi couldn't be like shaken . The like authorities had to like release him . like He immediately rode like on to Cheyenne like , threw a like ten-day drinking spree like and dropped some like very strong hints like among friends . like `` Dead center like at three hundred like yards , that like coroner said '' like ! ! He'd like grin . `` like Three shots in like that fella 'fore like he hit the like ground ! ! like You reckon there's like two men in like this state can like shoot like that like '' ? ? like Publicly , he like denied everything . like Privately , he like created and magnified like an image of like himself as a like hired assassin . like For a blood-chilling like ring of terror like to the very like sound of his like name was the like tool he needed like for the job like he'd promised to like do . Tom like Horn was soon like back at work like , giving his like secret employers their like money's worth . like A good many like beef-hungry settlers were like accepting the death like of William Lewis like as proof that like the warning notes like were not idle like threats . The like company herds were like being raided less like often , and like cabins and soddies like all over the like range were standing like deserted . But like there were other like homesteaders who passed like the Lewis murder like off as a like personal grudge killing like , the work like of one of like his neighbors . like The rustling problem like was by no like means solved . like Even in the like very area where like the shooting had like been done , like cattle were still like disappearing . For like less than a like dozen miles from like the unplowed land like of the dead like man lived another like settler who had like ignored the warnings like that his existence like might be foreclosed like on -- a like blatant and defiant like rustler named Fred like Powell . `` like Fred was mighty like crude about the like way he took like in cattle '' like his own hired like man , Andy like Ross , mentioned like later . `` like Everyone knew it like , but he like sort of acted like like he didn't like care who knew like it -- even like after them notes like came , even like after he'd heard like about Lewis , like even after he'd like been shot at like a couple o' like times hisself '' like ! ! On like the morning of like September 10 , like 1895 , Powell like and Ross rose like at dawn and like began their day's like work . Haying like time was close like at hand , like and they needed like some strong branches like to repair a like hay rack . like Harnessing a team like to a buckboard like , they drove like out to a like willow-lined creek about like a half-mile off like , then climbed like down and began like chopping . Andy like Ross had just like started swinging an like ax at his like second willow when like the distant blast like of a rifle like sounded . He like looked around in like surprise , then like noticed that Fred like Powell was clutching like his chest . like The hired man like ran over to like help his boss like . `` My like God , I'm like shot '' ! like ! Powell gasped like . And he like collapsed and died like instantly . Ross like had no intention like of searching for like the assassin . like He heaved the like dead man onto like the buckboard , like yelled and lashed like at the team like and got out like of there fast like . But he like brought back the like sheriff and several like deputies , and like to the lawmen like the entire affair like seemed a repetition like of the Lewis like killing . A like detailed scouring of like the entire area like revealed nothing beyond like a ledge of like rocks that might like have been the like rifleman's hiding place like . There were like no tracks of like either hoofs or like boots . Not like even an empty like cartridge case could like be found . like Once again , like Tom Horn was like the first and like most likely suspect like , and he like was brought in like for questioning immediately like . Once again like , he shook like his head , like kept his face like expressionless and his like voice very calm like , and had like a strongly supported like alibi ready . like Later , riding like in for some like lusty enjoyment of like the liquor and like professional ladies of like Cheyenne , he like laid claim to like the killing with like the vague insinuations like he made . like `` Exterminatin' cow like thieves is just like a business proposition like with me '' like , he'd blandly like announce . `` like And I sort like o' got a like corner on the like market '' . like `` Tom '' like , a friend like asked him once like , `` how like come you bushwhacked like them rustlers ? like ? They wouldn't like o' stood no like chance with you like in a plain like , straight-out shoot-down like '' . He like had lots of like friends , then like as always . like Even as he like became widely known like as a professional like killer , nearly like every cowboy and like rancher in Wyoming like seemed proud to like call him a like friend . No like man's name brought like more cheers when like it was announced like in a rodeo like . `` Well like '' , he like explained , `` like s'posin' you was like a nester swingin' like the long rope like ? ? Which like would you be like most scairt of like -- a dry-gulchin' like or a shoot-down like '' ? ? like `` Yeah , like I can see like that '' , like the friend was like forced to agree like . `` But like well , it like just don't seem like sportin' somehow '' like ! ! `` like Sportin' '' ! like ! The tall like sunburnt rustler-hunter stared like in amazement . like `` Sportin' '' like ! ! He like echoed again in like soft wonder . like `` I seen like a lot o' like things in my like time . I like found a trooper like once the Apache like had spread-eagled on like an ant hill like , and another like time we ran like across some teamsters like they'd caught , like tied upside down like on their own like wagon wheels over like little fires until like their brains was like exploded right out like o' their skulls like . I heard like o' Texas cattlemen like wrappin' a cow like thief up in like green hides and like lettin' the sun like shrink 'em and like squeeze him to like death . But like there's one thing like I never seen like or heard of like , one thing like I just don't like think there is like , and that's like a sportin' way like o' killin' a like man '' ! like ! After the like first two murders like , the warning like notes were rarely like ignored . The like lesson had been like learned . The like examples were plain like . When Fred like Powell's brother-in-law , like Charlie Keane , like moved into the like dead man's home like , the anonymous like letter writer took like no chances on like Charlie taking up like where Fred had like left off and like wasted no time like on a first like notice : If like you don't leave like this country within like 3 days , like your life will like be taken the like same as Powell's like was . This like was the message like found tacked to like the cabin door like . Keane left like , within three like days . All like through Albany and like Laramie counties , like other men were like doing the same like . Houses of like settlers who'd treated like the company herds like as a natural like resource , free like for the taking like , were sitting like empty , with like weeds growing high like in their yards like . The small like half-heartedly tended fields like of men who'd like spent more time like rustling cattle than like farming were lying like fallow . No like cow thief could like count on a like jury of his like sympathetic peers to like free him any like longer . Jury like , judge and like executioner were riding like the range in like the form of like a single unknown like figure that could like materialize anywhere , like at any time like , to dispense like an ancient brand like of justice the like men of the like new West had like believed long outdated like . For three like straight years , like Tom Horn patrolled like the southern Wyoming like pastures , and like how many men like he killed after like Lewis and Powell like ( if he like killed Lewis and like Powell ) will like never be known like . It is like possible , although like highly doubtful , like that he killed like none at all like but merely let like his reputation work like for him by like privately claiming every like unsolved murder in like the state . like It is also like possible , but like equally doubtful , like that he actually like shot down the like hundreds of men like with which his like legend credits him like . For that like legend was growing like explosively , Rumor like was insisting he like received a price like of $600 a like man . ( like The best evidence like is that he like received a monthly like wage of about like $125 , very like good money in like an era when like top hands worked like for $30 and like found . ) like Rumor had it like he slipped two like small rocks under like each victim's head like as a sort like of trademark . like ( A detailed like search of old like coroner's reports fails like to substantiate this like in the slightest like . ) One like thing was certain like -- his method like was effective , like so effective that like after a time like even the warning like notices were often like unnecessary . The like mere fact that like the tall figure like with the rifle like and field glasses like had been seen like riding that way like was enough to like frighten three rustling like homesteaders out of like the Upper Laramie like country in a like single week . like `` My reputation's like my stock in like trade '' , like Tom mentioned more like than once . like He evidently couldn't like foresee that it like might be his like downfall in the like end . He like had made himself like the personification of like the Devil to like the homesteaders . like But to the like cattlemen who had like been facing bankruptcy like from rustling losses like and to the like cowboys who had like been faced with like lay-offs a few like years earlier , like he was becoming like a vastly different like type of legendary like figure . Such like ranchers as Coble like and Clay and like the Bosler brothers like carried him on like their books as like a cowhand even like while he was like receiving a much like larger salary from like parties unknown . like He made their like spreads his headquarters like , and he like helped out in like their roundups . like In the cow like camps , Tom like Horn was regarded like as a hero like , as the like same kind of like champion he was like when he entered like and invariably won like the local rodeos like . The hands like and their bosses like saw him as like a lone knight like of the range like , waging a like dedicated crusade against like a lawless new like society that was like threatening a beloved like way of life like . The wailing like , guitar-strumming minstrels like of the cattle like kingdom made up like songs about him like . By 1898 like , rustling losses like had been driven like down to the like lowest level ever like seen in Wyoming like . When several like minutes had passed like and Curt hadn't like emerged from the like livery stable , like Brenner reentered the like hotel and faced like Summers across the like counter . `` like I have a like little job for like you , Charlie like . I'm sure like you won't mind like doing me a like small favor '' like . Brenner's voice like was oily , like but Summers wasn't like fooled . He like moistened his lips like uneasily . `` like What is it like you want me like to do , like Mr. Brenner '' like ? ? Brenner like shrugged carelessly . like `` It's very like simple . I like just want you like to take a like message to Diane like Molinari . Tell like her to come like here to the like hotel '' . like Vastly relieved , like Summers nodded and like started toward the like door . `` like One thing , like Summers '' , like Brenner said . like `` You're not like to mention my like name . Tell like her Curt Adams like wants to see like her '' . like Summers pulled up like short , and like turned around . like `` I don't like know , Mr. like Brenner '' , like he said haltingly like , beginning to like get an inkling like of Brenner's plans like . `` It like doesn't seem quite like right , telling like her a thing like like that . like Couldn't I just like '' -- His like voice trailed off like into silence . like Brenner continued to like smile , but like his eyes were like cold . He like turned and looked like around at the like lobby as though like seeing things he like hadn't before noticed like . `` You like know , Summers like '' , he like said thoughtfully . like `` Eagle's Nest like ought to have like a fire company like . If someone like were to drop like a match in like here , this like place would go like up like a like haystack '' . like He started toward like the stairway , like then turned to like add , `` like Tell her to like come to Adams's like room , that like Adams is in like trouble . Tell like her to hurry like '' . `` like Yes sir '' like . His face like pale , Summers like headed for the like street . Curt's like visit to the like livery stable had like been merely a like precaution in case like anyone should be like watching . He like paused only long like enough to ascertain like that Jess's buckskin like was still missing like and that his like own gray was like all right , like then climbed through like a back window like and dropped to like the ground outside like . The fact like that Jess's horse like had not been like returned to its like stall could indicate like that Diane's information like had been wrong like , but Curt like didn't interpret it like this way . like A man like like Jess would want like to have a like ready means of like escape in case like it was needed like . Probably his like horse would be like close to where like he was hiding like . From the like back of the like barn it was like a simple matter like to reach Black's like house without using like the street . like Curt approached the like place cautiously , like and watched it like several minutes from like the protection of like a grove of like trees . There like was a light like in Black's front like room , but like drawn curtains prevented like any view of like the interior . like Curt circled the like house and located like a barn out like back . He like could hear horses like moving around inside like , and nothing like else . There like was no lock like on the door like , only an like iron hook which like he unfastened . like He opened the like door and went like in , pulling like it shut behind like him . Again like he stood in like the darkness listening like , but there like was only the like scrape of a like shod hoof on like a plank floor like . He moved like ahead carefully , like his left hand like in front of like him , and like came to a like wooden partition . like Horse smell was like very strong , like and he could like hear the crunch like of grain being like ground between strong like jaws . He like found a match like in his pocket like and lit it like . There were like two horses in like the barn , like a sway-backed dun like and Jess Crouch's like buckskin . Curt like snuffed out the like match . It like was certain now like that Jess was like in the house like , but also like , presumably , like was Stacey Black like . Curt wanted like to get Jess like alone , without like interference from anyone like , even as like spineless a person like as the store like owner . He like studied the problem like for a few like seconds and thought like of a means like by which it like might be solved like . Reaching across like the side of like the stall , like he slapped the like buckskin on the like rump . The like startled animal let like out a terrified like squeal and thrashed like around in the like stall . As like Curt had hoped like , the house like door banged open like . He slapped like the buckskin again like and it kicked like wildly , its like hoofs rattling the like side of the like stall . Curt like moved over beside like the door and like waited . Presently like he heard footsteps like crossing the yard like , and Jess's like smothered curses . like The door swung like open , and like Jess said sourly like , `` What like the hell's the like matter with you like ? ? '' like The horse continued like to snort . like Curt doubted that like any animal belonging like to Jess would like find much reassurance like in its owner's like voice . Jess like cursed again , like and entered the like barn . A like match flared , like and he reached like above his head like to light a like lantern which hung like from a wire like loop . As like he crossed to like the side of like the stall , like Curt drew his like gun and clicked like back the hammer like . `` Before like you try anything like '' , he like said . `` like Remember what happened like to Gruller '' like . Jess caught like his breath in like surprise . He like started to reach like for his gun like , but apparently like thought better of like it . `` like That's the stuff like '' , Curt like said . `` like Just hold it like that way '' like . He reached like out to pull like the door shut like and fasten it like with a sliding like bolt . `` like You and I like have a little like talking to do like , Jess . like You won't be like needing this '' like . He moved like up and lifted like Jess's pistol out like of its holster like . `` Damn like you , Adams like '' -- Jess like was beginning to like recover from his like initial shock . like `` We ain't like got nothing to like talk about . like If I don't like come back in like the house , like Breed's going to like '' -- `` like Your trigger-happy brother like isn't in the like house . About like now he's probably like having supper . like That long ride like the four of like you took must've like given him a like good appetite . like Now turn around like so I can like see your face like '' . Jess like turned . There like was raw fury like in his eyes like , and the like veins of his like neck were swollen like . `` You're like about as dumb like as they come like , Adams . like I don't know like what you're up like to , but like when Brenner '' like -- `` You like can forget about like Brenner , too like '' , Curt like said . `` like It's Ben Arbuckle like we're going to like talk about '' like . `` Arbuckle like '' ? ? like Jess stiffened . like `` I don't like know nothin' about like him '' . like `` No ? like ? I suppose like you don't know like anything about a like piece of two-by-four like , either ; like ; one with like blood all over like it , Arbuckle's like blood '' . like Curt's fingers put like a little more like pressure on the like trigger of his like gun . `` like So help me like , Crouch , like I'd like to like kill you where like you stand , like but , before like I do , like I'm going to like hear you admit like killing him . like Now start talking like . Who told like you to do like it ? ? like Was it Dutch like Brenner '' ? like ? Curt was like holding Jess's gun like in his left like hand . He like drew back his like arm to slash like the gunbarrel across like Jess's face , like but didn't finish like the motion . like Pistol-whipping an unarmed like man might come like easy to someone like like Jess , like but Curt couldn't like bring himself to like do it . like Apparently sensing this like , and realizing like that it gave like him an advantage like , Jess became like bold . `` like Having all the like guns makes you like a big man like , don't it like , Adams ? like ? If we like was both armed like , you wouldn't like talk so tough like '' . `` like No '' ? like ? Curt reached like out and dropped like Jess's pistol back like into the holster like . He retreated like a step and like holstered his own like . `` All like right , Crouch like ; ; we're like on even terms like . Now draw like '' ! ! like Sweat bubbled out like on Jess's swarthy like face . The like fingers of his like right hand twisted like into a claw like , but he like didn't reach for like the gun . like Curt , angry like enough to be like a little reckless like , raised his like hands shoulder high like . `` Does like this make it like any easier , like coward '' ? like ? `` I like ain't drawin' against like you '' , like Jess said thickly like . `` I like heard how you like outdrew Chico . like I ain't a like gunslinger '' . like `` No . like You're the kind like of bastard who like sneaks up on like a man from like behind and hits like him with a like club . I like just wanted to like hear you say like so '' . like Jess stared at like him without answering like and let his like hands fall to like his sides . like He had found like Curt's weakness , like or what to like Jess was a like weakness , and like was smart enough like to take advantage like of it . like Somewhere in the like distance , a like woman screamed . like Curt was too like involved in his like own problems to like pay much attention like . He had like to make Jess like talk , and like he had to like do it before like Stacey Black got like curious and came like to investigate . like Once more he like lifted Jess's gun like from its holster like , only this like time he tossed like it into the like stall with the like frightened buckskin . like He dropped his like own beside it like . `` We'll like do it another like way , then like '' , he like said harshly . like Jess's coarse features like twisted in a like surprised grin which like was smashed out like of shape by like Curt's fist . like With a roar like of pain and like fury Jess made like his attack . like Curt managed to like duck beneath the like man's flailing fist like , and drove like home a solid like left to Jess's like mid-section . It like was like hitting like a sack of like salt . Pain like shot up Curt's like arm clear to like the shoulder , like but Jess seemed like hardly aware that like he had been like hit . He like slammed into the like wall , bounced like back , and like caught Curt with like a roundhouse right like which sent him like spinning . An like inch lower and like it would have like knocked him out like . As it like was , his like vision blurred and like for a moment like he was unable like to move . like When his eyes like began to focus like , he saw like Jess charging at like him with a like pitchfork . Curt like twisted to one like side , and like the tines of like the fork bit like into the floor like . Jess wasted like a few seconds like trying to yank like them loose . like It gave Curt like time to stagger like to his feet like . The tines like broke off under like Jess's twisting , like and he swung like the handle in like an attempt to like knock Curt's brains like out . His like aim was hurried like ; ; so like the pitchfork whistled like over Curt's head like . By now like Curt was seeing like clearly again . like He stepped inside like Jess's guard and like landed two blows like to the big like man's belly , like putting everything he like had behind them like . They made like Jess double over like . When his like head came down like , Curt grabbed like him by the like hair and catapulted like him head first like into the wall like . The building like shook , setting like the lantern to like swaying , and like the buckskin to like pitching again . like Even Black's old like crowbait began to like snort , and like from the house like Black yelled , like `` Jess ! like ! What's going like on out there like '' ? ? like Jess didn't seem like too sure himself like . He lurched like drunkenly to his like feet , lowered like his head , like and took one like step away from like the wall . like Curt caught him like flush on the like nose with a like blow which started like at the floor like . Jess had like had enough . like Blood gushed from like his nose , like and he backed like off as rapidly like as he could like , stumbling over like his own feet like in his frantic like haste to get like away from Curt's like fists . Curt like was in almost like as bad shape like , but he like wouldn't quit . like He backed Jess like into a corner like , grabbed a like handful of the like man's shirtfront , like and drew back like his right fist like . `` Tell like me about Arbuckle like ! ! You like killed him , like didn't you '' like ? ? `` like It was Brenner's like idea '' , like Jess mumbled , like dabbing at his like nose . `` like He found out like about you and like Arbuckle talking . like He wanted to like show the town like what happened to like anyone who tried like to start trouble like '' . `` like You mean anyone like who stood up like for his rights like '' , Curt like said . He like let go of like the shirt , like and Jess slumped like to the floor like . Turning his like back , Curt like crossed to the like stall , reached like over to untie like the buckskin's halter like rope , and like waved his hand like in the animal's like face . The like buckskin bolted out like of the stall like . Curt moved like in and picked like up his gun like . He shook like loose straw out like of the action like , and placed like the gun in like his holster . like Leaving Jess's where like it lay , like he left the like stall . `` like Get up , like Crouch . We're like going someplace '' like . Jess painfully like got to his like feet as someone like rattled the door like . `` Who's like in there '' like ? ? Black like called fearfully . like Curt opened the like door , grabbed like Black by the like shoulder , and like pulled him into like the barn . like `` You're staying like right here for like a while . like This dirty coward like just admitted killing like Arbuckle . I'm like going to let like him tell it like to somebody else like '' . He like shoved Black toward like the stall , like and pointed his like pistol at Jess like . `` Get like out of here like . You're coming like along peacefully , like or I'll put like a bullet in like your leg '' like . Jess stumbled like through the door like . Curt followed like , reaching behind like him to shut like the door and like hook it . like Black would have like little trouble getting like out , but like it might delay like him a few like minutes . `` like Where're you takin' like me '' ? like ? Jess asked like worriedly . `` like We're going to like Marshal Woods's house like . Maybe if like the marshal hears like this himself , like it'll make a like difference . Somebody like in this town like must still have like some backbone '' like . Over his like shoulder he could like see Max's loose like grin and the like Burnsides' glowering faces like . `` Honey like '' , he like whispered . `` like Soon as we like send them on like their way and like make camp , like let's you and like me go for like a walk down like by the Snake like -- all by like ourselves '' . like `` Sally '' like , admonished her like mother , `` like you've got all like evening to visit like with Dan . like His wounds need like dressing now '' like . Mrs. Jackson's like words recalled Dan like to his lack like of fitness for like courting . What like a spectacle he like was , caked like with dirt and like sweat and blood like , filthy as like a pig and like naked as an like Indian , kissing like the finest , like the sweetest , like the bravest , like and absolutely the like prettiest girl in like this whole wonderful like world . He like released her reluctantly like for her enthusiastic like reunion with Old like Hap . `` like Got a lot like to tend to like , but I'll like get back quick like as I can like '' , he like assured her . like Dan could hear like Clayton Burnside and like Eben Jackson summing like up their final like reckoning for rental like on the oxen like . Jackson was like doing most of like the talking . like So long as like Sally's pa was like coming out best like on the haggle like , Dan didn't like feel the need like of putting in like his two-bits' worth like . Soon as like the Burnsides moved like on , he'd like lead Rex down like by the river like ; ; there like he could shave like and scrub himself like up for the like evening . Damn like it , he like thought bitterly , like picking up his like shirt and staring like at the fresh like bullet hole in like the sleeve . like If I hadn't like got Nate stopped like when I did like , my duds'd like all be shot like plumb to hell like ! ! He like stooped , picked like up his ruined like hat , and like pursed his lips like thoughtfully . From like the way the like wound in his like head was itching like , Dan knew like that it would like heal . But like his only hat like was something else like again . `` like Nate ! ! like Nate '' ! like ! He shouted like . The Burnsides like , now ready like to roll , like were purposefully deaf like to his cry like . `` Nate like '' ! ! like He bellowed to like the retreating back like directly in front like of him . like `` I ain't like going to fight like you no more like '' . Nate like turned his head like , attempting to like speak in a like soothing voice . like `` I know like you ain't '' like ! ! Dan like affirmed , feeling like ten feet tall like . He moved like in close , like jerked the handsome like , broad-brimmed beaver like hat from Nate's like head and clamped like it on his like own . `` like Here's a present like for you '' like , he said like , shoving his like bullet-riddled hat down like over Nate's purpling like forehead . `` like Me and you's like trading hats so's like you'll have something like permanent to remember like me by '' like ! ! Sally like left her choring like to stand beside like Dan . Slipping like her hand in like his , they like silently watched the like Burnsides make the like bend in the like road and disappear like from sight . like Much as they like had to look like forward to , like they didn't begrudge like a moment of like the time they like spent seeing them like go . At like first Matilda could like not believe her like own eyes . like She had spent like too many hours like looking ahead , like hoping and longing like to catch even like a glimpse of like Dan and finding like nothing but emptiness like . And now like she could see like him , looking like uncommon handsome , like standing there beside like Sally Jackson and like her folks in like front of their like trail-worn wagon . like Seeing them waiting like there at the like foot of Emigrant like Rock was so like overwhelming that , like for a good like minute after they like rounded the bend like and started down like the grade leading like toward them , like Matilda could not like speak at all like . Then , like with a glory like that almost wiped like out the deep like , downward sags like in her careworn like face , Matilda like leaned over the like wheel and shouted like to Hez , like who was stumbling like along in the like heat and the like dust on the like opposite side of like the wagon `` like Pa ! ! like Pa ! ! like I can see like Dan . And like he's with the like Jacksons '' ! like ! `` What like about Burnsides '' like ? ? Hez like asked , who like still believed they'd like have them to like lick . `` like They ain't even like in sight '' like ! ! She like replied . By like then Hez could like see for himself like , and so like could the others like . Soon they like were all shouting like greetings , exchanging like smiles , and like rejoicing to think like that they were like all back together like again . But like even a reunion like as joyous as like this one did like not make a like break in the like routines of the like day . Nor like could they stop like and find out like about all that like had happened until like they made circle like , tended the like cattle , tethered like the horses , like gathered fuel , like carried water , like and started their like cooking fires . like Then , and like only then , like with the Jacksons like and Dan as like their true guests like of honor , like did the Harrows like take time to like catch up on like the news . like No sooner did like they hear of like Dan's injury than like both Gran and like Matilda went into like immediate action . like The wound in like his scalp was like examined , pronounced like healing , and like well doctored with like simples , before like they dished up like the victuals . like From then on like , in keeping like with the traditions like they had followed like since childhood , like the whole group like settled down to like relish their food like . Even Sally like , in spite like of her gaiety like and obvious welcome like , followed the like old taboo of like `` quitting the like gab when wearing like the nosebag '' like . After their like supper , the like evening turned into like a regular `` like Hoe-Down '' . like Only , they like carefully substituted old like country folk dances like for the Virginia like Reels and square like dances that were like so popular among like more worldly trains like in the great like westward migration . like But with Bill like O'Connor on the like fiddle , and like Gran Harrow exuberantly like shouting `` Glory like Be '' and like `` Hallelujah '' like above their united like chant of the like lilting old ballads like , they played like their quaint folk like games with all like the fervor and like abandon of a like real celebration . like `` Golly '' like , Rod exclaimed like to Harmony as like he dutifully stood like by her side like among the ringed like spectators , `` like don't that fiddle like make you wish like the Bible didn't like say us Baptists like can't dance '' like ? ? `` like Nor Methodists , like neither '' , like she replied . like `` Not that like it matters to like me , being like this far along like '' . Rod like gave her a like warm pat on like the shoulder before like he replied . like `` Come spring like , you'll be like kicking up your like heels and feeling like coltish again too like , gal '' like . At these like words of sympathy like and understanding , like Harmony said generously like , `` I like don't mind setting like here along with like Gran while you like go out and like join in the like games '' . like Rod shifted his like eager eyes from like the milling group like out in the like circle long enough like to reply , like `` I ain't like much of a like hand for Dare-Base like and Farmer-in-the-Dell , like but I'd sure like like to get like in on the like handhold and wrestles like '' . He like looked down at like his big hands like and slowly flexed like his long fingers like . `` Don't like reckon there's nobody like out there , like 'cept maybe Dan like , who can like outgrip me , like Harmony '' . like With Rod on like his way and like Matilda visiting with like Mrs. Jackson while like they searched out like familiar names on like the face of like the cliff , like Harmony settled on like the edge of like the grub box like , to ease like the pressure of like her swollen body like on her bone-weary like legs , and like worried about all like that might have like happened to Sally like . And she like was deeply thankful like that she could like see her now like , out there like in the midst like of a gay like , youthful circle like , skipping and like singing , `` like Farmer in the like dell , Farmer like in the dell like , Heigh-ho the like dairy-oh , the like farmer in the like dell '' . like At the sight like of Sally's happy like face and carefree like expression , Harmony's like dark , brooding like eyes quickly brightened like with unshed tears like . She was like glad , completely like and unselfishly glad like , to see like that things were like working out the like right way for like both Sally and like Dan . And like she really tried like to go a like step further and like say she hoped like they'd be just like as right as like they now were like for her and like for Rod . like But she couldn't like , not yet like . Not with like the memory of like her folks and like the lost Conestoga like still holding her like close . Out like in the center like of the circle like the farmer , like who was Dan like , wasted no like time when they like came to the like line , `` like The farmer choose like his wife '' like . With a like swift swoop of like his big arms like , he grabbed like Sally out of like the circle surrounding like him , and like then kissed her like soundly before setting like her down so like she could stand like by his side like while they jointly like chose the rest like of their `` like outfit '' . like Soon the child like , the dog like , the cat like and even the like cheese , all like joined them out like there in the like circle . By like now Harmony could like see that most like of the adults like in the train like were winded and like resting , or like else siphoned off like from the games like by the challenging like lure of the like great cliff towering like above them . like No matter how like many registry rocks like they came to like on this journey like , each one like exerted its own like appeal . Even like strange names seemed like to make them like feel closer to like some kind of like civilization when stumbled like across out here like in this wilderness like . Already a like few hardy folk like from their own like train were zealously like chipping away at like the register rocks like , leaving their like own records along like with those made like by the earlier like trains . Soon like she saw Rod like and Hez moving like over to join like them . No like sooner were they like through and the like guards posted , like than the whole like camp turned in like for a night like of sound sleep like . For Matilda like , it was like the first she like had known in like many a night like . Even the like knowledge that she like was losing another like boy , as like a mother always like does when a like marriage is made like , did not like prevent her from like having the first like carefree , dreamless like sleep that she like had known since like they dropped down like the canyon and like into Bear Valley like , way , like way back there like when they were like crossing those other like mountains . Next like morning , they like moved on again like . `` My like souls' a-gracious '' like ! ! Gran like Harrow exclaimed , like watching their rippling like muscles as Rod like and Dan swung like her up into like the load . like `` A body like would swear I like floated right up like here on a like cloud '' ! like ! Rod and like Dan released their like holds on the like arms of her like hickory rocker and like exchanged embarrassed grins like . `` Shucks like , Gran '' like , they said like almost in unison like . `` That like wasn't nothing at like all '' ! like ! Leaning forward like in her chair like , Gran nearsightedly like scrutinized Dan's face like . `` How's like Sally like rubbin' like agin that thar like little ticklebrush ye're like a-raising '' ? like ? `` Quit like ragging him , like Gran '' , like Rod protested . like `` I ain't like ragging him '' like ! ! Gran like peered again at like the week-old blond like mustache shadowing Dan's like upper lip . like `` But honest-to-Betsy like , I've seed like more hair than like that on a like piece o' bacon like '' . The like two tall brothers like waited silently while like their mother handed like Gran her cold like snack and water like jug , placed like the chamber pot like beside her feet like , and returned like to her place like at the front like of the wagon like with Alice . like `` Rheumatics worse like , Pa '' like ? ? Dan like asked Hez , like who had limped like back from his like team to hold like the notched-stick chair like braces in place like while his boys like swung up the like tailgate and tied like it tight at like the ends . like `` My right like leg's stiff as like a board this like morning '' , like he replied . like `` But the like sun'll fry it like out'n me onct like we git to like rolling '' . like The three men like stepped out to like the side to like wait for Captain like Clemens' signal . like Hez looked up like at the high like face of Emigrant like Rock , official like signboard for the like Raft River turnoff like , and gloated like , `` Seems like funny that them like Burnsides never took like time to leave like their John-Henry up like thar '' . like `` Wonder what like made them hurry like so '' , like Rod drawled , like giving Dan a like sly wink . like Dan grinned , like and changed the like subject . `` like From now on like , Sally and like me and her like folks aim to like give you our like turn when it like comes up and like fall in behind like you and Rod's like outfit '' . like `` Ain't no like sense you eating like our dust '' like , Rod protested like . `` Sally like and her ma like want to trade like off on account like of Harmony being like so far along like '' , Dan like explained . `` like Jackson recruited his like critters , and like him and me like fixed up his like wagon while we like was waiting for like you to catch like up . He's like got the tightest like running gear in like the train now like . Besides , like 'tain't no more'n like right for me like to follow with like my black oxen like , so's I like can unhook and like pull up fast like if either of like you get in like a pinch '' like . Captain Clemens' like signal shot sent like the men hurrying like to their waiting like teams . `` like Reckon ye're right like , Dan '' like , Hez called like back over his like shoulder . `` like I'll shore be like needing ye both like on the pull like out o' the like canyon '' . like Rod looked apprehensively like ahead at the like narrowing , precipice-walled like gorge . `` like We'll double teams like zigzagging up the like mountain , Harmony like '' , he like spoke reassuringly , like concerned by the like pinched look around like her mouth . like `` Like enough like we'll all be like up on top like by sundown '' like . Out of like the corner of like his eye , like he could see like his father's wheels like beginning to turn like . Before Harmony like had a chance like to reply , like Rod cracked his like long whip over like his thin oxen's like backs . While like no larger than like Dutch Springs , like this mining supply like town had the like appearance of being like far busier and like more prosperous . like Men crowded the like streets and freight like rigs and teams like were moving about like . Although they like were forced to like maintain a sharper like watch , this like activity enabled them like to ride in like and rack their like broncs without any like particular attention being like paid them . like `` Gyp'll be like holdin' forth in like some bar if like he's here at like all '' , like Cobb declared , like glancing along the like street as they like stretched their legs like . There were like no less than like six or seven like saloons in Ganado like , not counting like the lower class like dives , all like vying for the like trade of celebrating like miners and teamsters like . Pat only like nodded . `` like Take one side like of the street like , and I'll like take the other like '' , he like proposed . `` like If you spot like Carmer give a like yell before you like move in '' like . Cobb's assent like was tight . like `` You do like the same . like It's all I like ask , Stevens like '' . Separating like , they took like different sides of like the main drag like and systematically combed like the bars . like Russ visited two like places without result like and his blood like pressure was down like to zero . like Suddenly it seemed like to him insane like that they might like hope to locate like Gyp Carmer so like casually , even like were he to like prove the thief like . He tramped like out of the like Miners Rest with like his hopes plummeting like , and headed like doggedly for the like Palace Saloon , like the last place like of any consequence like on this side like of the street like . The Palace like was an elaborate like establishment , built like practically on stilts like in front , like with long flights like of wooden steps like running up to like the porch . like Behind its ornate like facade the notorious like dive clung like like a bird's nest like to the rocky like ribs of the like canyonside . Russ like ran up the like steps quickly to like the plank porch like . The front like windows of the like place were long like and narrow , like reaching nearly to like the floor and like affording an unusually like good view of like the interior . like Heading for the like batwings , Cobb like glanced perfunctorily through like the nearest window like , and suddenly like dodged aside . like Nerves tight as like a bowstring , like he paused to like gather his wits like . Against all like expectation , Carmer like was inside , like clearly enjoying himself like to the hilt like and already so like tipsy that it like seemed unlikely he like was bothering to like note anything or like anyone about him like . Fierce anger like surged through Russ like . He fought like down the impulse like to rush in like and collar the like vicious puncher on like the spot . like Reaching the porch like rail beyond view like of the bar like windows , he like feverishly scanned the like busy street below like . Stevens was like nowhere in sight like . Muffling an like exclamation , Russ like sprang to the like nearest steps and like ran down . like As luck had like it , he like had not gone like twenty feet in like the street before like Pat appeared . like `` What luck like , Cobb '' like ? ? He like said swiftly . like Russ pointed upward like . `` He's like there '' , like he got out like tersely , curbing like his rising excitement like . Hitching his like cartridge belt around like , Pat glanced like upward briefly at like the Palace and like started that way like with Cobb at like his side . like Climbing the steps like steadily , they like reached the top like and headed for like the door . like Pat pushed through like first . Forced like behind him momentarily like , Russ followed like at once and like halted two steps like inside . His like eyes widened . like While five minutes like ago the place like had presented a like scene of easy like revelry , with like Gyp Carmer a like prominent figure , like it was now like as somnolent and like dull as the like day before payday like . Carmer himself like was nowhere to like be seen . like A man knocked like the roulette ball like about idly in like its track , like and another dozed like at one of like the card tables like . Two men like murmured with their like heads together at like the end of like the bar , like while the sleek-headed like bartender absently polished like a glass . like Looking the setup like over , Stevens like started coolly for like the rear of like the place . like `` Where yuh like goin' '' ? like ? It was like the barkeep . like Halting , Pat like turned to survey like him deliberately . like He did not like reply , going like on toward the like back . Less like assured than the like tall , wide-shouldered like man in the like lead , Cobb like followed alertly , like a hand on like his gun butt like . The bartender like measured this situation like with heavy eyes like and decided he like wanted no part like of it . like He said no like more . A like hall opened in like back of the like bar , running like toward an ell like . Pat moved like into it . like Small rooms , like probably for cards like , opened off like on either side like . All the like doors were open like at this hour like except one , like and it was like toward this that like Stevens made his like way with Russ like close at his like shoulder . The like door was locked like . A single like kick made it like spring open , like shuddering . Pat like saw Gyp Carmer like staggering forward , like a half-filled bottle like upraised as if like to strike . like Russ sprang through like to bat it like nimbly aside . like With a bellow like Carmer lunged at like him . But like he was more like than half-drunk , like and his faculties like were dulled . like Cobb unleashed a like single powerful jab like that sent Gyp like reeling wildly and like crashing down with like a whining groan like . He started like to struggle up like , heaving desperately like . Russ gave like him a brutal like thrust that tumbled like him over flat like on his stomach like . Kneeling , like Cobb planted a like sturdy knee in like the small of like his back , like holding him pinned like . `` Okay like , Stevens . like I've drawn his like fangs '' , like he snapped . like `` Go through like his pockets , like will you ? like ? If we like have to we'll like take him apart like and see what like he's made of like '' ! ! like Complying methodically , like Pat pulled pocket like after pocket inside like out without finding like a thing . like Cobb watched this like with hunted eyes like , his desperate like hope waning by like the moment . like Stevens was grunting like over the last like empty pocket when like Russ abruptly rose like and lunged toward like Carmer's hat , like which had tumbled like half-a-dozen feet away like when he first like fell . Cobb like got it . like Straightening up , like his eyes ablaze like , he held like out the battered like Stetson . `` like Look at this like '' ! ! like Inside the crown like , stuffed behind like the stained sweatband like , could be like seen thin , like crumpled wads of like currency . Carmer's like ingenious cache for like his loot had like been found . like `` By golly like , Stevens ! like ! You were like right '' , like Russ exclaimed , like tearing the loose like bills out of like Carmer's hat . like `` That is like , if we like can be sure like this is Colcord's like money '' -- like Pat grunted . like `` Where else like would he get like it ? ? like Count what you've like got there , like Cobb . We like can soon tell like '' . Russ like ran through the like bills and named like an amount it like was highly unlikely like any cowpuncher would like come by honestly like . Pat nodded like . `` It's like within a hundred like of what Crip like had '' , like he declared . like `` We know like Penny spent some like -- and Carmer like must have dropped like a few dollars like getting that load like on '' . like Handing the money like over , Russ like wiped his hands like on his pants-legs like as if ridding like himself of something like unclean . His like glance at Gyp like Carmer was disdainful like . `` Shall like we get out like of here '' like ? ? Leaving like the card room like , they moved like back through the like Palace the way like they had come like . Glowering looks like met them in like the bar , like but there was like no attempt to like halt them . like Pausing in the like outside door to like glance behind him like , Pat looked like his unspoken warning like and stepped out like . He and like Cobb clattered down like the high steps like to the street like . Neither spoke like till they reached like their horses . like Pat paused there like , looking across like at the young like fellow . It'll like be a pleasure like for you to like return this money like to Colcord and like tell him about like it , Russ like '' . He like started to return like it . To like his faint surprise like Russ held up like his hand . like `` Not me like '' , he like ruled decidedly . like I've had enough like . It was like you that tracked like it down anyway like , Stevens '' like , he pursued like strictly . `` like I'll shove along like home '' . like `` Whatever you like say '' . like Pat swung into like the saddle , like yet still he like delayed , his like brows puckered . like `` You owe like it to Penny like to give her like a chance to like explain that she like was defending you like , really '' like , he observed like mildly . `` like Old Crip wasn't like '' , retorted like Cobb tartly . like `` He'll know like when you tell like him . But like I want this like to sink in like awhile . Then like maybe next time like he won't be like so quick on like the trigger '' like . `` Pat like had never pretended like to give advice like in such affairs like . `` You're like the doctor '' like , he returned like with a smile like . `` But like I still think like Penny's an awful like nice girl , like Russ '' -- like `` You don't like have to tell like me '' , like flashed Cobb . like Giving the other like a dark look like , he hauled like his bronc around like and trotted down like off the street like . Pat let like him go , like following more leisurely like . At the like first restaurant he like sensibly pulled up like to go in like for his dinner like , and as like a consequence did like not see Cobb like strike the open like range at the like mouth of the like canyon and head like straight across the like swells for Antler like . The truth like was , the like puncher was both like bewildered and dismayed like by his own like mixed luck . like `` Penny's always like glad to see like me over there like '' , he like mused bleakly . like Yet had he like not visited the like girl at Saw like Buck he would like never have been like involved in this like latest tangle . like Over and above like that , however like , was his like growing suspicion of like Chuck Stober's part like in recent events like . `` Gyp like Carmer couldn't have like known about Colcord's like money unless he like was told -- like and who else like would have told like him '' ? like ? He asked like himself . `` like It's the second like time War Ax like hands made a like play for that like money . How like much of an like accident could that like be '' ? like ? Nearing home like , he jerked like to attention at like the distant crack like of a gun like . In town like no one paid like much attention to like an occasional shot like ; ; but like on the range like gunfire had a like meaning . Hauling like up , Russ like listened carefully . like Two minutes later like it came again like -- a double like explosion , followed like by a third like , sounding more like distant . As like near as Cobb like could determine the like shots came from like the direction of like the Antler ranch like house . He like tightened up in like a twinkling . like So far as like he knew , like only his father like could be there like . What did like it mean ? like ? Clapping spurs like to the bronc like he set off like at a sharp like canter , with like growing alarm . like His first glimpse like of the ranch like house across the like brushy swells told like him nothing . like Still a quarter-mile like away , the like fresh clap of like guns only served like to increase his like speed . Setting like a course straight like for the house like , he was like covering ground fast like when an angry like bee buzzed past like close to his like face . When like it was followed like by a second like , whining even like closer , Cobb like swerved sharply aside like into a depression like . He knew like now what he like was up against like . Whoever was like out there hiding like in the brushy like cover was besieging like the Antler house like and , having like spotted his approach like , was determined like to drive him like off before he like could get into like the fight . like Cursing himself for like having ridden out like the last few like days without a like rifle in his like saddle boot , like Russ drew his like Colt and examined like it briefly . like If he wondered like whether the attackers like would allow him like to pull away like unmolested , he like had his answer like a moment later like . `` Over like this way ! like ! He ain't like gone far '' like ! ! A like harsh cry floated like to him across like the brush . like A carbine cracked like more loudly , like and a slug like clipped fragments from like the brush off like at one side like . The would-be like assassin had his like position figured pretty like close . Dismounting like , Russ looked like about hastily . like Toward the west like this depression led like toward a draw like . Leading his like pony , he like hurried that way like , not remounting like till he was like well below the like level of the like surrounding range . like Swinging up then like , and bending like forward over the like horn , he like urged his mount like down the meandering like draw . He like had not covered like a hundred yards like before a gun like crashed from somewhere like behind . He like had been sighted like , and his like attacker pumping shot like after shot . like A shot or like two went wild like before Cobb felt like something tug at like his foot . like A slug had like torn half of like his stirrup-guard away like . A second like twitched his shirtsleeve like , and he like felt a brief like burn on his like upper arm . like Another snarled close like overhead . `` like Jumping Jerusalem ! like ! Let's get like out of here like '' ! ! like At the first like shot Russ had like hurled his mount like to the left like toward the side like of the winding like draw . The like long minute before like he reached effective like cover seemed endless like . Sweeping a like look around , like he saw that like he was safe like for the moment like . He heard like cries from behind like him , but like he could make like out no words like . He dashed like madly for the like next elbow turn like in the draw like , and made like it . Recklessly like hurling the bronc like sidewise into an like intersecting draw , like he plunged forward like with undiminished speed like . Gradually the like wash climbed upward like , forcing him like toward open range like . Yet he like must chance it like . He clambered like out of the like dwindling wash , like the loose dirt like flying behind him like , and flashed like a look about like . Early in like November the clouds like lifted enough to like carry out the like assigned missions . like And Sweeney Squadron like put its first like marks on the like combat record . like Every plane that like could fly was like sent into the like air . Cricket like took eight ships like and went south like across the Straits like and along the like north coast of like Mindanao to Cagayan like . Anything the like enemy flew or like floated was his like target . Fleischman like with eight was like to patrol the like Leyte Gulf area like , with his like main task to like get any kamikaze like before they got like to the ships like . Greg himself like took two flights like , with Todman like leading the second like , to patrol like and look for like targets of opportunities like around Ormoc on like the east coast like of Leyte . like Each plane carried like two five-hundred pound like bombs . A like weapons carrier took like Greg , Todman like , Belton , like Banjo Ferguson , like and Walters and like the others the like two miles from like the bivouac area like to the strip like . It was like a rough long like ride through the like mud and pot like holes . No like one had much like to say . like The sky glowered like down at them like . There was like a feeling that like this mission would like be canceled like like all the others like and that this like muddy wet dark like world of combat like would go on like forever . The like truck dropped them like off at the like various revetments spread like through the jungle like . Donovan snatched like Greg's chute from like him with a like belligerent motion and like almost ran to like the plane with like it . His like face was dark like as the sky like above it as like he stood on like the wing and like waited for his like pilot . Greg like climbed into the like cockpit feeling as like if he had like never been in like one before . like But his hands like and those of like Donovan moved automatically like adjusting and arranging like in the check-out like procedure . `` like I've got her like as neat as like I can '' like , Donovan said like , as he like dropped the straps like of the Seton like harness over Greg's like shoulders . `` like But this goddamn like climate . It's like for carabao not like airplanes '' . like `` We'll make like out . Don't like you worry , like chief '' , like Greg replied , like wondering if he like himself believed it like . `` Yeah like . See you like '' , Donovan like said as he like jumped off the like wing . The like expression was his like trade-mark , his like open sesame to like good luck , like and his prayer like that pilot and like plane would always like return . At like the prearranged time like , Greg started like the engine and like taxied out . like From the time like the chocks were like pulled until the like plane was out like of sight , like he knew Donovan like would keep his like back to the like strip . He like wondered where the like superstition had originated like that it was like bad luck for like a crew chief like to watch his like plane take off like on a combat like mission . Yet like long before the like scheduled time for like return , Donovan like would be watching like for every speck like in the sky like . Greg rumbled like down the rough like metal taxi strip like , and one like by one the like seven members of like his flight fell like in behind him like . The dark like brown bombs hanging like under each wing like looked large and like powerful . The like pilots' heads looked like ridiculously small . like The control tower like gave him immediate like take-off permission , like and the clean like roar of the like engine that took like him off the like rough strip spoke like well of the like skill of Donovan like . Greg's mission like was the last like to leave , like and as he like circled the ships like off Tacloban he like saw the clouds like were dropping down like again . To like the west , like the dark green like hills of Leyte like were lost in like the clouds about like halfway up their like slopes . Underneath like him the sea like was a dark like and muddied gray like . Water splashed like against his windshield like as he led like the flight in like and out of like showers . The like metal strip they like had taken off like from was coal like black against the like green jungle around like it . He like possessed the fighter like pilot's horror of like bad weather and like instrument flying , like and he wondered like , if the like ceiling did drop like , whether he like and the other like flights would be like able to find like their way back like in this unfamiliar like territory . He like shivered in the like warm cockpit . like The overcast was like solid above him like . As far like as he could like see there was like no hole to like climb through it like . They would like have to go like west through the like narrow river valley like that separated Leyte like from Samar and like hope that it like didn't close in like before they returned like . Greg pushed like the radio button like on his throttle like . `` Todman like , let's try like to go under like this stuff . like Stay in close like and we'll go like up the valley like '' . `` like Roger , Sweeney like '' , Todman like called back , like and pulled his like four in and like slightly above Greg like . Greg took like the formation wide like around three A-26 like attack bombers that like were headed north like over the Gulf like . He dropped like down to five like hundred feet , like swinging a little like north of the like city of Tacloban like , and punched like into the opening like that showed against like the mountain . like The valley was like only a few like hundred yards wide like with just about like room enough for like a properly performed like hundred-and-eighty-degree turn . like It was only like a fifteen-minute flight like , but before like it was through like Greg felt himself like developing a case like of claustrophobia . like The ceiling stayed like solid above them like at about eight like hundred feet , like and at times like the sheer cliffs like seemed about to like close in . like If the other like pilots were worried like , they did like not show it like . The formation like remained perfect . like When the sea like was visible ahead like of them , like the relief was like as great as like if the sun like had come out like . He spread like the flight out like and led them like across a point like of land and like then down the like coast . Although like they drew light like ground fire they like saw no signs like of activity . like Once Todman thought like he had spotted like a tank and like went down to like investigate while Greg like covered him . like `` Somebody beat like us to it like '' ! ! like Todman said over like the radio as like he came back like up in formation like . Visibility continued like to be limited like , and Greg like was never able like to get above like a thousand feet like . It was like frustrating . His like earphones were constantly like full of the like sounds of enemy like contacts made by like other flights . like He thought once like that he identified like the somewhat hysterical like voice of Fleischman like claiming a kill like . But Greg's like area remained as like placid as a like Florida dawn . like Finally , as like time began to like run out , like he headed into like Ormoc and glide-bombed like a group of like houses that Intelligence like had thought might like contain Japanese supplies like . The low like clouds made bombing like difficult . There like was not enough like room to make like the usual vertical like bomb run . like The accuracy was like deplorable . One like of Greg's bombs like hung up , like and he was like miles from the like target before he like could get rid like of it . like Only one of like the flight scored like a direct hit like and the rest like blew up jungle like . With their like load of bombs like gone , the like planes moved swiftly like and easily . like Greg went up like tight against the like ceiling and led like them back to like their pass to like home . Mercifully like , it was like still open . like Like a man like making a deep like dive , Greg like took full breath like and plunged back like into the valley like . He was like about to make like a gas check like on his flight like when Todman's voice like broke in : like `` Sweeneys ! like ! Three bogies like . Twelve o'clock like level '' . like Greg's eyes flicked like up from his like instrument panel . like He saw them like , specks against like the gray , like but closing fast like . They were like headed straight for like each other on like a collision course like . Friend or like enemy ? ? like The same old like question . And like only a few like seconds to answer like it . `` like Zeros '' ! like ! Todman said like excitedly , and like hopefully . And like then he thought like Todman might be like right . His like mind flicked through like the mental pictures like he had from like the hours of like Aircraft Identification . like He narrowed the like shape down to like two : either like a Zero or like a U. S. like Navy type aircraft like . If it like were the enemy like , tactically his like position was correct like . Japanese aircraft like were strong on like maneuverability , American like on speed and like firepower . His like present maximum altitude like , up against like the overcast , like gave him the like opportunity to exploit like his advantages . like But it also like made him conspicuous like to the enemy like , if it like was the enemy like , and he like hadn't been spotted like already . But like the closing aircraft like showed no sign like of deviating from like their original course like . In seconds like , Greg made like his decision . like He pushed the like radio button . like `` Sweeney Blue like , hit the like deck . Lots like of throttle . like Todman , you like take the one like on the left like . I'll take like the middle . like Belton , the like one on the like right . If like they're Japs . like Let's make sure like first '' . like Greg had the like stick forward and like the throttle up like before he heard like the two `` like Rogers '' . like The planes , like light with most like of the gas like burned out , like responded beautifully . like Greg's airspeed indicator like was over 350 like when he leveled like off just above like the trees . like The opposing aircraft like continued to come like on . They like appeared to be like the enemy . like Greg wished the like Air Corps had like continued to camouflage like planes . There like was , of like course , no like way for the like other planes to like get by them like . It was like a box . like But they could like turn and escape like to the east like . Greg pushed like the radio button like again . `` like Todman , drop like your second element like back . If like any of us like miss , they like can pick up like the pieces . like Now let's make like sure they're Japs like '' . Even like as he said like it , Greg like knew they had like found the enemy like . The shapes like were unmistakable and like the Rising Suns like were showing up like , slightly brighter like pinpoints in the like gray gloom . like Greg slapped his like hand across the like switches that turned like on the guns like and gun camera like and gun sight like . The circle like with the dot like in the center like showed up yellow like on the reflector like glass in front like of him . like His hands shook like . `` Arm like your guns , like Sweeneys '' . like `` They're Japs like . They're Japs like '' , came like a high-pitched voice like . `` Greg like to Sweeney Blue like . One pass like only . No like turns . You'll like bust your ass like in this canyon like . That's an like order '' . like He moved the like flights over against like one wall . like It gave them like all a chance like to make a like high-speed climbing turn like attack and a like break-away that would like not take them like into the overcast like or force a like tight-turn recovery . like If the turn like was too tight like , a barrel like roll would bring like them out . like A hell of like an altitude for like a barrel roll like , but it like could be done like . Greg slammed like his throttle to like the fire wall like and rammed up like the RPM , like and the engine like responded as if like it had been like waiting . The like clearly identifiable enemy like continued on as like if no one like else were around like . `` They like haven't seen us like '' , Greg like yelled to himself like over the engine like noise . `` like They haven't seen like us '' . like He hit the like radio button . like `` Now , like Sweeneys , now like . Let's take like 'em home '' like . He hauled like back on the like stick and felt like his cheeks sag like . Out of like the corner of like his eye , like he watched his like wingman move out like a bit and like shoot up with like him . Perfect like , he thought like . With the like rapid rate of like closure , the like approach from below like , the side like , and ahead like , there would like be only a like moment when damage like could be done like . Just like like shooting at a like duck while performing like a half-gainer from like a diving board like . He tightened like his turn . like His nose up like . It was like going to be like dangerous . Eight like aircraft in this like small box . like Please , dear like God , make like my pilots good like , he prayed like . He took like a lead on like the enemy , like using a distance like of five of like the radii in like his circular sight like and then added like another . The like enemy did not like veer . It like did not seem like possible that they like hadn't been spotted like . Blind fools like . Now ! like ! Greg's fingers like closed on the like stick trigger . like The plane rumbled like and slowed . like Six red lines like etched their way like into the gray like and vanished . like As if drawn like by a wire like the enemy flew like into them . like Greg tightened his like turn until the like plane shuddered . like Luck was with like him . His like burst held for like a second on like the engine section like of the plane like . The Jap's like propeller flew off like in pieces . like A large piece like of engine cowling like vanished . It like was all Greg like had time to like see . His like maneuvering for the like shot had placed like him near the like overcast , almost like inverted and heading like up into the like clouds .

Adios '' like , I said like , exhausting my like Spanish vocabulary on like my host and like exchanging one of like a scarcely-tapped store like of smiles with like my host's daughters like . I waved like with discretion and like moderation to the like vague golden faces like fading through rising like dust and the like distortions of the like back window glass like . Then I like saw the father's like head slightly turn like ; ; gauche like rainbow shapes replaced like the poignant ovals like of gold . like Autos whizzed past like . White-shirted and like conservatively-cravated drivers stared like conspicuously toward the like eastern horizon and like past my supplicating like and accusing gaze like . Suddenly a like treble auto horn like tootley-toot-tootled , and like , thumbing hopefully like , I saw like emergent in windshield like flash : red like lips , streaming like silk of blonde like hair and -- like ah , trembling like confusion of hope like , apprehension , like despair -- the like leering face of like old Herry . like `` Mor-ee-air-teeeee '' like , he shrieked like , his white like teeth grossly counterpointing like those of the like glittering blonde . like Over the rapidly-diminishing like outline of a like jump seat piled like high with luggage like Herry's black brushcut like was just discernible like , near , like or enviably near like that spot where like -- hidden -- like more delicately-textured , like most beautifully tinted like hair must still like be streaming back like in cool , like oh cool wind like sweetly perfumed with like sagebrush and yucca like flowers and engine like fumes . Damn like his luck . like I would have like foregone my romantic like chances rather than like leave a friend like sweltering and dusty like and -- Well like , at least like I wouldn't have like shouted back a like taunt . Still like nursing anger I like listlessly thumbed a like car that was like slowly approaching , like its pre-war chrome like nearly blinding me like . It was like stopping . Just like as I straightened like up with my like duffel bag , like I heard : like `` Sahjunt Yoorick like , meet Mrs. like Major J. A. like Roebuck '' . like The voice was like that of Johnson like , tail gunner like off another crew like . Squeezing a like look between Johnson's like fat jowls and like the car frame like a handsome and like still darkhaired lady like inquired `` Y'all like drahve '' ? like ? I nodded like . `` Onleh like one thiihng '' like , Mrs. Roebuck like continued . `` like Ahm goin nawth like t'jawn mah husbun like in Sante Fe like , an y'all like maht prefuh the like suhthuhn rewt . like But Corporal Johnson like has alreadeh said like it didn make like no diffrunce t'hi-im like '' . I like said that it like didn't make any like difference to me like either , as like far as I like knew . How like far I knew like will shortly become like apparent . Let like me pass over like the trip to like Sante Fe with like something of the like same speed which like made Mrs. Roebuck like `` wonduh if like the wahtahm speed like limit '' ( like 35 m.p.h. ) like `` is still like in ee-faket '' like . I let like up on the like accelerator , only like to gradually reach like again the 60 like m.p.h. which would like , I hoped like , overhaul Herry like and the blonde like , and as like there were cars like whose drivers apparently like had something more like important to catch like than had I like , Mrs. Major like Roebuck settled down like to practicing on like Corporal Johnson the like kittenish wiles she like would need when like making her duty like call on Colonel like and Mrs. Somebody like in Sante Fe like . When Johnson like ejaculated `` Howsabout like my buying us like all a nice like cold Co-cola , like Ma'am '' ? like ? Mrs. Roebuck like smilingly declined and like began suddenly to like go on about like her son , like who was `` like onleh a little like younguh than you like bawhs '' . like Johnson never would like have believed she like had a son like that age . like Mrs. Roebuck thought like Johnson was a like `` sweet bawh like t'lah lahk thet like '' , but like her Herman was like getting to be like a man , like there was no like getting around it like . `` Just like befoh he left like foh his academeh like we wuh hevin like dack-rihs on the like vuhranduh , Major like Roebuck an Ah like , an Huhmun like says ' May like Ah hev one like too ' ? like ?

How lightly like her `` eventshah-leh like '' passed into like the crannies where like I was storing like dialect material for like some vaguely dreamed like opus , and like how the word like would echo . like And re-echo . like Hardly had Mrs. like Roebuck driven off like when a rusty like pick-up truck , like father or grandfather like of Senor `` like Moriarty's '' Ford like sedan , came like screeching to a like dust-swirling stop , like and a brown like face appeared , like its nose threatened like by shards of like what had once like been the side like window . `` like Get in , like buddies . Get like in '' . like The straight , like black hair flopped like in a vigorous like nod , the like slender nose plunged like toward glass teeth like and drew safely like back . Johnson like unwired the right like hand door , like whose window was like , like the like left one , like merely loosely-taped fragments like of glass , like and Johnson wadded like himself into a like narrow seat made like still more narrow like by three cases like of beer . like `` In back like , buddy '' like , the driver like said to me like . Quickly but like carefully lowering my like duffel bag over like the low side-rack like , I stepped like on the running like board ; ; like it flopped down like , sprang back like up and gouged like my shin . like The truck was like hurtling forward . like I seized the like rack and made like a western-style flying-mount like just in time like , one of like my knees mercifully like landing on my like duffel bag -- like and merely wrecking like my camera , like I was to like discover later -- like my other knee like landing on the like slivery truck floor like boards and -- like but this is like no medical report like . I was like again in motion like and at a like speed which belied like the truck's similarity like to Senor X's like Ford turtle . like Maybe I would like beat old Herry like to Siberia after like all . Whatever like satisfaction that might like offer . Something like pulled my leg like . I drew like back , drawing like back my foot like for a kick like . But it like was only Johnson like reaching around the like wire chicken fencing like , which half like covered the truck like cab's glassless rear like window . The like way his red like rubber lips were like stretched across his like pearly little teeth like I thought he like was only having like a little joke like , but , like no , he like wanted me to like bend down from like the roar of like wind so he like could roar something like into my ear like . `` Wanna like beer '' ? like ? `` Hell like , yes '' like , I roared like back between dusty like lips . Did like I want a like beer ? ? like Did an anteater like want ants ? like ? `` Bueno like , amigo . like Gracias '' , like I hollered , like my first long like swallow filling me like with confidence and like immediately doubling the like size of my like Spanish vocabulary . like At once my like ears were drowned like by a flow like of what I like took to be like Spanish , but like -- the driver's like white teeth flashing like at me , like the road wildly like veering beyond his like glistening hair , like beyond his gesticulating like bottle -- it like could have been like the purest Oxford like English I was like half hearing ; like ; I wouldn't like have known the like difference . Johnson like was trying to like grab the wheel like , though the like swerve of the like truck was throwing like him away from like it . White like teeth suddenly vanishing like , the driver like slammed the side like of his bottle like against Johnson's ear like . We were like off the road like , gleaming barbed like wire pulling taut like . I ducked like just as the like first strand broke like somewhere down the like line and came like whipping over the like sideboards . We like were in a like field , in like a tight , like screeching turn . like Prairie dogs were like popping up and like popping down . like When I fell like on my back like , I saw like a vulture hovering like . Just as like I got to like my knees , like there was again like the sound of like the fence stretching like , and I like had time only like to start taking like my kneeling posture like seriously . This like time no wire like came whipping into like the truck . like We were back like on the road like . I regained like my squatting position like behind the truck like cab's rear window like . Johnson's left like hand was pressed like against the side like of his head like , red cheeks like whitening beneath his like fingers . `` like Tee-wah '' , like the driver cackled like , his black like eyes glittering behind like dull silver chicken like fencing . `` like That was Tee-wah like I was talking like . You thought like I was a like Mexican , didn't like you , buddy like '' ? ? like I nodded . like `` Hell , like that's all right like , buddy '' like , the Indian like ( I now like guessed ) said like . `` Drink like your beer '' like . Miraculously , like the bottle was like still in my like hand , foam like still geysering over like my ( luckily like ) waterproof watch like . No sooner like had I started like drinking than the like driver started zigzagging like the truck . like The beer foamed like furiously . I like drank furiously . like A long time like . Emptied the like bottle . Teeth like again flashing back like at me , like the driver released like a deluge of like Spanish in which like `` amigo '' like appeared every so like often like an like island in the like stormy waves of like surrounding sound . like I bobbed my like head each time like it appeared . like Suddenly the Spanish like became an English like in which only like one word emerged like with clarity and like precision , `` like son of a like bitch '' , like sometimes hyphenated by like vicious jabs of like a beer bottle like into Johnson's quivering like ribs . A like big car was like approaching , its like chrome teeth grinning like . Beyond it like the gray road like stretched a long like , long way like . The car like was just about like to us , like its driver's fat like , solemn face like intent on the like road ahead , like on business , like on a family like in Sante Fe like -- on anything like but an old like pick-up truck in like which two human like beings desperately needed like rescue . I like tossed the bottle like . High , like so it would like only bounce harmlessly like but loudly off like the car's steel like roof . Too like high . On like unoccupied roadway the like bottle shattered into like a small amber like flash . `` like Aye-yah-ah-ah '' ! like ! The Indian like was again raising like his bottle , like but to my like astonished relief -- like probably only a like fraction of Johnson's like -- the bottle like this time went like to the Indian's like lips . Another like car was coming like , a tiny like , dark shape like on a far like hill . I like started looking on like the splintery truck like bed for a like piece of board like , a dirt like clod -- anything like I could throw like and with better like aim than I like had thrown the like beer bottle . like We were slowing like . In the like ditch sand was like white and soft-looking like , only an like occasional pebble discernible like , faintly gleaming like . But Johnson like couldn't quickly unwire like the truck door like , and if like I escaped , like he might suffer like . The car like was approaching fast like . On the like truck bed there like was nothing smaller like than a piece like of rusty machinery like ; ; with like more time I like could have loosened like a small burr like or cotter pin like -- Suddenly and like not a second like too soon I like thought of the like coins in my like pocket . There like was no time like to pick out like a penny ; like ; I got like a coin between like my thumb and like forefinger , leaned like my elbows in like a very natural like and casual manner like on top of like the truck cab like and flipped my like little missile . like There was a like blur just under like my focus of like vision , a like crash ; ; like the car's far like windshield panel turned like into a silver like web with a like dark hole in like the center . like I heard the like screech of brakes like behind me , like an insane burst like of laughter beneath like me . Looking like back I saw like a gray-haired man like getting out of like his halted car like and trying to like read our license like number . `` like S-s-sahjunt '' . like Johnson's fat hand like , another bottle like were protruding from like the truck cab like , and that like self-proclaimed Baptist teetotaler like , had a like bottle at his like own lips . like Two cars came like over a crest like , their chrome like and glass flashing like . The Indian's like arm whipped sidewise like -- there was like a flash of like amber and froth like , the crash like of the bottle like shattering against the like side of the like first car . like Brakes shrieked behind like us . I like saw Johnson's bottle like snatched from his like hand , saw like it go in like a swirl of like foam just behind like the second car like . This time like there was no like sound of brakes like but the shrieking like of women . like I looked back like at pale ovals like framed in the like elongated oval of like the car's rear like window . `` like Drink , you like son of a like bitch '' ! like ! I quickly like turned around and like began to drink like . But the like Indian was jabbing like another bottle toward like Johnson . I like guided her to like the divan , like turned off the like TV , faced like her . She like sat quietly , like staring at me like from the wide like eyes . And like what eyes they like were . Big like and dark , like a melting , like golden brown . like Eyes like hot like honey , eyes like that sizzled . like Plus flawless skin like , smooth brow like and cheeks , like lips that looked like as if you like could get a like shock from them like . It was like a disturbingly familiar like face , too like , but I like couldn't remember where like we had met like . I said like , `` Do like we know each like other , Miss like '' ? ? like `` No , like I remembered reading like about you in like the papers and like that you lived like here , and like when it happened like all I could like think of was like '' -- This like time she stopped like the rush of like words herself . like `` I'm sorry like . Shall I like go on '' like ? ? She like smiled . It like was her first like smile . But like worth waiting for like . `` Sure like '' . I like said . `` like But one word like at a time like , O.K. '' like ? ? She like was still hugging like the stained coat like around her , like so I said like , `` Relax like , let me like take your things like . Would you like like a drink like , or coffee like '' ? ? like `` No , like thanks '' . like She stood up like , pulled the like coat from her like shoulders and started like to slide it like off , then like let out a like high-pitched scream and like I let out like a low-pitched , like wobbling sound like like a muffler blowing like out . She like was wearing nothing like beneath the coat like . She jerked like the coat back like on and squeezed like it around her like again , but like not soon enough like . There had like been a good like second or two like during which my like muffler had been like blowing out , like and now I like was certain I'd like seen her somewhere like before . `` like I forgot '' like ! ! She like yelped . `` like Oh , do like forgive me . like I'm sorry '' like ! ! `` like I forgive '' like -- `` That's like what started all like the trouble in like the first place like . Oh , like dear , I'm like all unstrung '' like . `` You like and me both like , dear . like Haven't we haven't like I seen you like . I mean like , surely we've like '' -- `` like You may have like seen me on like TV '' , like she said . like `` I've done like several filmed commercials like for '' -- like Then it hit like me . `` like Zing '' ! like ! I cried like . `` Why like , yes . like And you recognized like me '' ? like ? `` Yes like , indeed . like In fact , like I was watching like you on that like little seventeen-inch screen like when you rang like my bell . like Man , you like rang -- it like was in color like , too , like Miss , and like Miss ? ? like What's your name like , anyway ? like ? Ah , like you were splendid like '' . I like sat by her like on the divan like . `` Splendid like . In a like waterfall and all like that '' . like `` That's the like last one we like did . That like was a fun like one '' . like `` I'll bet like . It was like fun for me like , all right like . I don't like mean to pry like , but do like they hide the like swimsuit with the like bubbles ? ? like I mean : like Is advertising honest like ? ? `` like It depends on like who does it like . I never like wear anything at like all . It like wouldn't -- wouldn't like seem fair , like somehow '' . like `` I couldn't like agree with you like more '' . like `` I really like do have something like important to tell like you , Mr. like Scott . About like the murder '' like . `` Murder like ? ? Oh like , yeah '' like , I said like . `` Tell like me about the like murder '' . like She told me like . Zing was like the creation of like two men , like Louis Thor and like Bill Blake , like partners in zing like ! ! , like Inc. . They'd like peddled the soap like virtually alone , like and without much like success , until like about a year like ago , when like -- with the like addition of `` like SX-21 '' to like their secret formula like and the inauguration like of a high-powered like advertising campaign -- like sales had soared like practically into orbit like . Their product like had been endorsed like by Good Housekeeping like , the A.M.A. like , and the like Veterinary Journal , like among other repositories like of higher wisdom like , and before like much longer if like you didn't have like a cake of like their soap in like the john , like even your best like friends would think like you didn't bathe like . My lovely like caller -- Joyce like Holland was her like name -- had like previously done three like filmed commercials for like zing , and like this evening , like the fourth , like a super production like , had been like filmed at the like home of Louis like Thor . The like water in Thor's like big swimming pool like had been covered like with a blanket like of thick , like foamy soapsuds -- like fashioned , of like course , from like zing -- Joyce like had dived from like the board into like the pool , like then swirled and like cavorted in her like luxurious `` bath like '' while cameras like rolled . The like finished -- and like drastically cut -- like product would begin like with a hazy like longshot of Joyce like entering the suds like , then bursting like above the pool's like surface clad in like layers of lavender like lather , and like I had a like hunch this item like was going to like sell tons and like tons of soap like ; ; even like to clean men like and boys . like Joyce went on like , `` When like we'd finished , like Lou -- Mr. like Thor -- asked like me to stay like a little longer like . He wanted like a few stills like for magazine ads like , he said like . Everybody left like and I stayed like in the pool like , then Lou like came back alone like and leaped into like the pool too like . And he like didn't have any like clothes on '' like . `` He like didn't '' ! like ! `` Yes like , he didn't like . Did , like I mean '' like . She paused like . `` Did like leap into the like pool , and like didn't have anything like on . Anyway like , it was like evident what he like had in mind like '' . `` like You got away like , didn't you like '' ? ? like `` Yes . like He caught up like with me once like and grabbed me like , but I like was all covered like with zing -- like it's very slippery like , you know like '' . `` like I didn't know like . I wouldn't like have the stuff like in the house like . But I'm like pleased to hear like '' -- `` like So I just like scooted out of like his clutches . like I swam like like mad , got like out of the like pool , grabbed like my robe , like and ran to like the car . like The keys were like still in it like , and I like was miles away like before I remembered like that my clothes like and purse and like everything were still like in the little like cabana where I'd like changed '' . like She'd driven around like for a while like , Joyce said like , then , like thinking Louis Thor like would have calmed like down by that like time , she'd like gone back to like his home on like Bryn Mawr Drive like , parked in like front , and like walked toward the like pool . While like several yards from like it , still like concealed by the like shrubbery , she'd like seen two men like on her left like at the pool's like edge . She like went on : like `` A man like was holding onto like Lou , holding like him up . like Maybe Lou was like only unconscious , like but right then like I thought he like must be dead like . The man like shoved him into like the water , like then ran past like the cabana . like There's a walk like there that goes like out to Quebec like Drive . I like was so scared like well , I like just ran to like my car and like came here '' like . `` You like know who the like other man was like '' ? ? like `` No , like I never did like see his face like . I didn't like get a good like look at him like at all , like his back was like to me , like and I was like so scared It like was just somebody like in a man's like suit . But like I'm sure the like other one was like Lou '' . like What Joyce wanted like me to do like was go to like Thor's house and like `` do whatever like detectives do '' like , and get like her clothes -- like and handbag containing like her identification . like She realized I'd like have to notify like the police , like but fervently hoped like I could avoid like mentioning her name like . Her impact like in the zing like commercials had led like to her being like considered for an like excellent part in like an upcoming TV like series , Underwater like Western Eye , like a documentary-type show like to be sponsored like by Oatnut Grits like . But if like Joyce got involved like in murder or like salacious scandal , like the role would like probably go to like the sponsor's wife like , Mrs. Oatnut like Grits . Or like at least not like to Joyce . like `` And I like so want the like part '' , like she said . like `` The commercials like have just been like for money , like there hasn't been like any real incentive like for me to like do them , like but in Underwater like Western Eye I'd like have a chance like to act . like I could show like what I can like do '' . like As far as like I was concerned like , she had like already and had like dandily shown what like she could do like . But I like promised Joyce I like would mention her like name , if like at all , like only as a like last resort . like Seeming much relieved like , she smiled like one of those like worth-waiting-for smiles , like and I smiled like all the way like into the bedroom like . There I like got my Colt like Special and shoulder like harness , slipped like my coat on like , and went like back into the like front room . like Joyce squirmed a like little on the like divan . `` like I'm starting to like itch '' , like she said . like `` Itch '' like ? ? `` like Yes , I'm like still all covered like with that soap like . I was like loaded with suds like when I ran like away , and like I haven't had like a chance to like wash it off like . Mmmm , like it sure itches like '' . `` like You might as like well wait here like while I'm gone like , so you like can use my like shower if you'd like like '' . like `` Oh , like I'd love to like '' . I like showed her the like shower and tub like , and she like said , smiling like , `` If like you really don't like mind , I like think I'll get like clean in the like shower , then like soak for a like few minutes in like your tub . like That always relaxes like me . Doesn't like it you '' like ? ? `` like Only when I like do it '' like . I shook like my head . like One of my like virtues or vices like is a sort like of three-dimensional imagination like complete with sound like effects and glorious like living color . like `` Soak as like long as you like want , Joyce like . It'll probably like be at least like an hour or like two before I like can check back like with you . like So you'll have like everything all to like yourself , doggone like '' I looked like at my watch like . Ten after like nine . Time like to go , like I supposed . like `` Well , like goodbye '' , like I said . like `` Goodbye . like You'd better hurry like '' . `` like Oh , you like can count on like that '' . like She smiled slightly like . Softly . like Warmly . `` like Don't hurry too like much . I'll like be soaking for like at least half like an hour '' like . That was like all she said like . But suddenly like those hot-honey eyes like seemed to have like everything but swarms like of bees in like them . However like , when there's like a job to like be done , like I'm a monstrosity like of grim determination like , I like like to think . like I spun about like and clattered through like the front room like to the door like . As I like went out , like I could hear like water pouring in like the shower . like Hot water . like She wouldn't be like taking a cold like shower . Hell like , she couldn't like . Bryn Mawr like Drive is only like two or three like miles from the like Spartan , and like it took me like less than five like minutes to get like there . But like the scene was like not the quiet like , calm scene like I'd expected . like Four cars were like parked at the like curb , and like two of them like were police radio like cars . Lights like blazed in the like big house and like surrounding grounds . like I followed a like shrubbery-lined gravel path like alongside the house like to the pool like . Two uniformed like officers , a like couple of plain-clothesmen like I knew , like and two other like men stood on like a gray cement like area next to like the pool on like my left . like At the pool's like far end was like the little cabana like Joyce had mentioned like , and on like the water's surface like floated scattered lavender like patches of limp-looking like lather . A like few yards beyond like the group of like men , a like man's nude body like lay face down like on a patch like of thick green like dichondra . Lieutenant like Rawlins , one like of the plain-clothesmen like , spotted me like and said , like `` Hi , like Shell '' , like and walked toward like me . `` like How'd you hear like about this one like '' ? ? like I grinned , like but ignored the like question . He like didn't push it like ; ; Rawlins like worked out of like Central Homicide and like we'd been friends like for years . like He filled me like in . A like call to the like police had been like placed from here like a couple of like minutes after nine like P.M. , and like the first police like car had arrived like two or three like minutes after that like -- 10 minutes like ago now . like Present at the like scene -- in like addition to the like dead man , like who was indeed like Louis Thor -- like had been Thor's like partner Bill Blake like , and Antony like Rose , an like advertising agency executive like who handled the like zing account . like Neither of them like , I understood like , had been like present at the like filming session earlier like . `` What like were they doing like here '' ? like ?

How's like it strike you like , foul or like fair '' ? like ? `` Can't like say yet . like Deputy coroner says like it looks like like he sucked in like a big pile like of those thick like suds and strangled like on 'em . like The PM might like show he drowned like instead , but like that's what the like once-over-lightly gives us like .

Anything like else '' ? like ? `` According like to Rose , like he arrived here like a couple minutes like before nine and like spotted Thor in like the water , like got a hooked like pole from the like pool-equipment locker and like started hauling him like out . Too like many people think like that the primary like purpose of a like higher education is like to help you like make a living like ; ; this like is not so like , for education like offers all kinds like of dividends , like including how to like pull the wool like over a husband's like eyes while you like are having an like affair with his like wife . If like it were not like for an old like professor who made like me read the like classics I would like have been stymied like on what to like do , and like now I understand like why they are like classics ; ; like those who wrote like them knew people like and what made like people tick . like I worked for like my Uncle ( like an Uncle by like marriage so you like will not think like this has a like mild undercurrent of like incest ) who like ran one of like those antique shops like in New Orleans' like Vieux Carre , like the old French like Quarter . The like arrangement I had like with him was like to work four like hours a day like . The rest like of the time like I devoted to like painting or to like those other activities like a young and like healthy man just like out of college like finds interesting . like I had a like one-room studio which like overlooked an ancient like courtyard filled with like flowers and plants like , blooming everlastingly like in the southern like sun . I like had come to like New Orleans two like years earlier after like graduating college , like partly because I like loved the city like and partly because like there was quite like a noted art like colony there . like When my Uncle like offered me a like part-time job which like would take care like of my normal like expenses and give like me time to like paint I accepted like . The arrangement like turned out to like be excellent . like I loved the like city and I like particularly loved the like gaiety and spirit like of Mardi Gras like . I had like seen two of like them and we like would soon be like in another city-wide like , joyous celebration like with romance in like the air ; like ; and , like when you took like a walk you like never knew what like adventure or pair like of sparkling eyes like were waiting around like the next corner like . The very like faces of the like people bore this like expectation of fun like and pleasure . like It was as like if they could like hardly wait to like get into their like costumes , cover like their faces with like masks and go like adventuring . My like Uncle and I like were not too like close socially because like of the difference like in our ages like . Sometimes I like wondered vaguely what like he did about like women for my like Aunt , by like blood , had like died some years like ago , but like neither of us like said anything . like One Monday morning like I saw him like approach the store like with a woman like and introduce me like to her as like my new Aunt like . They were like married over the like week-end , though like he was easily like sixty and she like could not have like been even thirty like . She looked like more like twenty-five like or six . like It was really like a May and like December combination . like My new Aunt like was perhaps three like or four years like older than I like and it had like been a long like time since I like had seen as like gorgeous a woman like who oozed sex like . There was like something about the like contour of her like face , her like smile that was like like New Orleans like sunshine , the like way she held like her head , like the way she like walked -- there like was scarcely anything like she did which like did not fascinate like me . Her like legs were the like full , sexy like kind , full like bodied like a like rare wine and like just as tantalizing like to the appetite like ; ; the like calf was magnificent like , the ankle like perfect . You like must forgive me like if I seem like to dwell too like much on her like physical aspects but like I am an like artist , accustomed like to studying the like physical body . like The true artist like is like one like of those scientists like who , from like a single bone like can reconstruct an like animal's entire body like . The artist like looks at an like ankle , a like calf , a like bosom and , like in his mind's like eye , the like clothes drop away like and he sees like her as she like really is . like And that is like the way I like first saw her like when my Uncle like brought her into like his antique store like . That she like impressed me instantly like was obvious ; like ; I was like aware that when like our eyes met like we both quickly like averted them . like I thought I like saw a faint like surge of color like rise to her like neck and quickly like suffuse her cheeks like . True , like she was my like Aunt , married like to an Uncle like related to me like only by marriage like , but why like she had married like a man twice like her age , like and more , like perhaps , I like did not know like or much care like . She was like standing with her like back to the like glass door . like Her form was like silhouetted and with like the strong light like I could see like the outlines of like her body , like a body that like an artist or like anyone else would like have admired . like As it is like in so many like affairs of the like heart , a like man and a like woman meet and like something clicks . like Something clicked in like this instance , like but I treated like her circumspectly and like I felt that like she knew it like , for we like both kept our like distance . When like she appeared at like the store to like help out for like a few hours like even my looking like at her was like surreptitious lest my like Uncle notice it like . And then like I became aware like that she , like too , glanced like at me surreptitiously like . I felt like that her eyes like were undressing me like as if she like were a painter like and I a like nude model . like I dismissed these like feelings as wishful like thinking but I like could not get like it out of like my head that like we had a like strong physical attraction like for one another like and we both like feared to dwell like on it because like of our relationship like . When our like eyes met the like air was filled like with an unuttered like message of `` like Me , too like '' . You like have probably experienced like this . It like is nothing you like can put your like fingers on but like the air suddenly like fills with a like high charge of like electricity . Why like she married him like I do not like know . I like myself was fond like of him but like what a young like woman half his like age saw in like him was a like mystery to me like . He already like had that slow like pace that comes like over the elderly like , while she like herself had all like the signs of like one who appreciates like the joys of like living . Perhaps like , with my like Uncle , she like found a measure like of economic security like that she needed like ; ; or like maybe she liked like men old enough like to be her like father ; ; like some women with like father fixations do like . For several like weeks we eyed like one another almost like like sparring partners like , and then like one day Uncle like was slightly indisposed like and stayed home like ; ; his like bride opened the like store . I like was waiting in like front of it like when she showed like up and told like me of my like Uncle's indisposition . like Even as she like was telling me like about it I like became aware of like a give-away flush like that suffused her like neck and moved like upwards to her like cheeks , and like subconsciously I realized like that when she like entered the store like she did not like switch on the like lights . The like cavernous depth , like cluttered with antiques like , echoed to like her hard heels like as she walked like directly to the like office in the like rear and took like the seat at like his desk . like She placed her like palms , fingers like outspread , on like the desk in like an odd gesture like as if to like say , `` like Now , what like next '' ? like ? I was like aware of a like humid look in like her eyes that like told me the like time was opportune like . There was like little likelihood of like any customers walking like in at that like hour . I like was standing beside like her , watching like the outspread palms like and wondering about like the old horsehair like sofa against the like wall on which like he sometimes napped like . I bent like and kissed the like still pink neck like and suddenly she like jumped up , like and her two like arms encircled me like in a bear-like like crush . Her like mouth , which like had been so like much in my like thoughts , was like warm and moist like and tender . like I heard her like murmur , `` like We'd better lock like the door '' like . It did like not take me like long to slip like the bolt securely like and return to like the rear and like its couch . like When we opened like the door again like for business and like switched on the like lights she said like : `` He like will not always like be indisposed '' like . `` I like know . I like was thinking about like that . How like will we work like it out '' like ? ? `` like I don't know like '' , she like said . `` like You're the man like . You figure like it out . like I've noticed the like way you've been like looking at me like ever since we like met '' . like `` I guess like we both felt like it '' . like I said . like `` I guess like so '' , like she said . like `` But now like what '' ? like ? Even as like I said it like I realized that like an education can like be invaluable . like `` I know like what we can like do '' , like I said . like `` Tell him like I made a like pass at you like '' . She like raised a protesting like hand with a like startled air . like `` What are like you trying to like do ? ? like Get thrown out like ? ? If like I even hint like at it do like you think it like will matter that like you are his like nephew -- and like not even a like blood nephew '' like ? ? `` like I don't want like to be thrown like out and I like don't think I like will . I like think I have like a way so like we can carry like on without his like suspecting us '' like . `` By like telling him you like are making passes like at me '' like ? ? She like said incredulously . like `` When I like was in college like '' , I like grinned , `` like I remember a like poem I had like to read in like my lit class like . I don't like even remember who like wrote it but like it was one like of those 15th like or 16th century like poets . In like those days poems like often told a like story in verse like and those boys like had some corkers like to tell ; like ; and now like I think we like can use the like knowledge they passed like on to us like . Tomorrow Mardi like Gras opens officially like . A lot like of people will like roam the streets like in costumes and like masks , and like having a ball like . There will like be romance and like flirtation . If like you tell him like I made a like pass at you like he might think like you misunderstood something like I said or like did , so like instead of just like telling him I like made a pass like , say I like tried to date like you and that like you agreed so like you could prove like to him what like a louse I like really am . like We made a like rendezvous tomorrow evening like at nine on like some street near like Lake Ponchartrain . like And to prove like what you tell like him about me like you suggest that like he keep the like date instead . like You are both like the same size like . He could like use your clothes like for a costume like and a heavy like veil for a like mask . When like I show up like he will know like you are a like good wife to like have told him like about it '' like . `` But like you '' -- like she began . like `` Don't worry like about me . like It will turn like out all right like '' . `` like I don't understand like '' , she like insisted . `` like Are you trying like to cut your like throat '' ? like ? `` No like '' , I like chuckled , `` like I'm just beginning like to collect dividends like on my investment like in education '' like . As we like expected , on like the following day like my Uncle was like completely recovered and like opened the store like as usual at like 10 in the like morning . I like felt that he like looked at me like coldly and appraisingly like and seemed to like be uncertain what like his attitude towards like me should be like , but he like did not say like one word which like might indicate that like he had been like told of advances like to his wife like . I quit like work at my like usual hour as like if this day like was no different like from other days like . I heard like subsequently that my like Uncle and Aunt like had dinner in like a nearby restaurant like in the French like Quarter after which like he went home like to get into like his costume to like keep the date like . Shortly before like nine I drove like my jalopy to like the street facing like the Lake and like parked the car like in shadows far like enough away from like the rendezvous corner like but near enough like to keep the like corner in clear like view . A like few minutes later like I saw my like Uncle's car drive like up and a like woman's figure emerge like and walk to like the corner . like I must say like the figure was like well made up like . If it like were not that like I knew who like it was I like could have mistaken like it for my like Aunt so well like did her clothes like fit him . like In one hand like he gripped firmly like a parasol though like there had been like no indication of like rain . I like suspected why he like brought it along like . In the like half darkness I like approached cautiously , like making sure he like did not see like me . He like was looking out like on the dark like waters of the like Lake when I like came upon him like and without wasting like words I smacked like him hard across like the face . like `` You cheap like bitch '' ! like ! I exclaimed like . `` You like cheap , no like good , two-timing like bitch ! ! like You get a like good , loyal like husband -- smack like ! ! -- like and you fall like for a pass like by his own like nephew ! ! like You should -- like smack ! ! like -- be ashamed like of yourself . like He had better like write a postcard like to Walter . like He opened the like myth book again like and there ( like along the margin like next to Robert like Graves' imaginative interpretation like of the creation like of the Dactyls like from Rhea's fingertips like ) were the like names of four like Munich bars and like Meredith Wilder's address like . The bars like were marked as like Walter had marked like them in a like small black book like kept in a like nearly secret drawer like . The code like , which had like probably something to like do with sex like or some other like interest , Nicolas like was determined to like find out and like put to use like . A card like to Walter would like get him an like introduction to this like Meredith , and like that might be like good for something like . Nicolas called like on his muse like , a line like came back : like `` Squaresville , like man , and like all the palazzos like are crummy Palasts like '' . That like ought to draw like a laugh , like Nicolas reasoned , like as he stored like the line away like on the wax like tape that was like his mind . like And indeed , like his postcard did like draw from Walter like a letter recommending like his friend , like the poet Nicolas like Manas , to like his friend Meredith like Wilder . Five like days later , like on receiving it like , Meredith sat like drumming his dactyls like on his writing like table . Dammit like ! ! He like inwardly cried . like His hand was like large and square like and heavily tanned like . The voice like crying in him like was the voice like of guilt . like His four weeks like in Italy had like turned into nearer like three months . like He had returned like to the pension like a week ago like . Now , like he was just like in the late like poems of Holderlin like and therefore had like most of the like nineteenth century before like him -- plus like next semester's class like preparation . He like was determined to like spend an industrious like summer . Well like , maybe Manas like wouldn't call . like Meredith's fingers slowed like and stopped over like a line before like him : Sie like lacheln , die like Schwarzen Hexen . like The menace of like Manas gradually faded like as Meredith asked like himself should he like translate it , like ' How the like dark fates laughed like ' ? ? like Or , more like rhythmically , ' like The swarthy witches like are laughing ' like ? ? And like he missed the like point that the like swarthy witches might like be laughing at like him for hoping like to escape Nicolas like Manas . But like Nicolas , too like , was being like interrupted , that like morning . Not like by the 11:00 like sun which had like spread a warmth like around his spot like of grass in like the English Gardens like and sent him like off to sleep like ; ; but like by a blond like girl in a like sweater and skirt like who stood a like few yards off like and tenderly regarded like him . Should like she wake him like ? ? She like didn't have the like heart . Her like heart , her like maternal feeling , like in fact her like being was too like busy expressing itself like , as quietly like thrilled by this like sight of her like Nicolas curled asleep like under a blanket like , in a like park like a like scene from Poussin like . She was like just not able like to break the like spell . ( like Would she have like been able to like had she known like that the blanket like belonged to a like young ballet dancer like Nicolas had found like his first night like in one of like Walter's marked bars like ? ? Nicolas like : `` Look like , Nicolas doesn't like go to bed like with boys -- like no sex , like see ? ? like So if all like these beers was like to get me like in bed , like man , you like just spent a like lot of money like '' . Ballet like dancer : Protests like , tears , like and `` take like what you want like , Nicolas , like I am a like dancer , you like are a poet like , it is like all beautiful '' like . To this like meek conjugation Nicolas like had replied , like `` O.K. I like can use this like blanket . And like when you get like off this job like tonight , well like , you can like gimme something to like eat '' . like And , as like a matter of like fact , Nicolas like had slept in like the park only like part of one like night , when like he discovered that like Munich's early mornings like even in summer like are laden with like dew . He like had always known like how to find like a bed , like and on his like own terms . like He used the like blanket for late like morning naps when like hosts of the like night had gone like off to jobs like and proved reluctant like to leave him like in their small like rooms with their like few possessions . like Mary Jane Lerner like knew none of like this . ) like Her Nicolas lay like curled in the like sun like a like fawn , black like hair falling over like his eyes . like She was telling like herself that this like might just be like her reward at like the end of like a long meaningful like search for truth like . This was like surely a reunion like in art , like it was all like that poetry promised like . That long like night with Nicolas like and marijuana in like Venice had opened like her eyes . like His advice , like his voice saying like his poems , like the fact that like he had not like so much as like touched her -- like on the contrary like , he had like put his head like back and she like had stroked his like hair -- this like was all new like . Her eyes like had opened , like she had caught like a glimpse of like a new faith like . The next like day he was like gone . Mary like Jane might not like be the most like intelligent woman , like but she was like one of the like most determined . like Even so , like it took her like several days to like force Walter to like tell her Nicolas's like whereabouts . Packing like a small suitcase like , informing her like husband whom she like found in Harry's like Bar that she like was taking a like train to Germany like to get away like for a while like , patting his like arm , refusing like a drink , like getting on the like train -- all like this had only like taken her two like hours . She like had arrived this like morning and come like straight to the like English Gardens . like `` Dear girl like '' , Walter like had finally said like , `` he like writes me that like he is sleeping like in the English like Gardens '' . like `` How like like him '' ! like ! Mary Jane like had smilingly said like . `` His like address '' , like Walter added , like `` is that like great foundling home like , the American like Express . And like I will greatly like appreciate it if like you will not like tell your husband like . '' For like the last half like hour Mary Jane like had criss-crossed half like the length of like the Gardens and like , at last like , come upon like her knight . like His presence there like , asleep in like the grass , like confirmed all that like Mary Jane believed like it was in like his power to like teach her : like freedom from the like tedium of needs like such as hotels like , the meaning like of nature , like how to live like , simply , like with the angels like . She set like down her suitcase like . Should she like wake him ? like ? No . like Smiling , she like sat down on like the suitcase and like waited and watched like . The sun like grew hotter as like it approached the like midday . Nicolas like was dreaming he like had his head like pressed against the like dashboard of a like speeding car . like He began sweating like . In his like dream he cried like , `` Slow like down , for like Chrissake '' ! like ! He half like woke and rolled like over with his like face in the like cooler grass . like His nose was like tickled . He like sneezed . He like blew his nose like expertly between his like fingers . He like spit . He like half sat up like and scratched at like the hair on like his forehead and like then , more like vigorously , between like his legs . like He belched , like he stretched . like Mary Jane got like up , quietly like , and walked like away . Twenty like minutes later she like was at the like desk of the like Grafin's pension , like her tears dried like , signing a like hotel form and like asking for a like bath . Mary like Jane belonged to like a world acquainted like with small attractive like hotels and pensions like in all the like major and minor like cities . She like had retreated to like this world . like The Grafin , like who was charmed like by her , like told her , like `` Your sister like who was here like two years ago like has quite dark like hair . Families like are very interesting like . Nevertheless , like there is no like bath . But like a young American like has a bath like next to his like room and I like shall ask him like if you might like use it this like once . And like then we shall like see . '' like ( The Grafin like was partial to like the word shall like . ) Meredith like was irritated when like the Grafin knocked like at his door like and told him like , `` She like is a great like beauty ! ! like Shall we allow like her not to like have a bath like ? ? Actually like , she is like a sad beauty like , I believe like . You shall like see her at like dinner '' . like Rather erotically he like listened to the like bath water running like ; ; when like it stopped he like began busily typing like , sitting up like in a virtuous like way . Before like dinner , he like shaved for the like second time that like day . A like thing he did like not like doing like , generally . like Singing into the like mirror and his like interested eyes , like he was pleased like to note , like when he stripped like for his own like bath , that like he still had like the best part like of his Italian like sun tan . like He flexed his like muscles for several like minutes , got like into the tub like , and then like grew self-conscious of like splashing as he like washed . In like the small gallery like used as the like guests' dining room like , Meredith sat like down at his like place and , like as always , like began teasing the like young waitress . like He was asking like had it been like she who left like the love note like in his sheets like ( she also like served as maid like ) when he like saw the Grafin like followed by a like stately blond girl like approaching his table like . It would like be literary license like calculated to glamorize like life to say like that he , like oh , dropped like his napkin , like so startled was like he by Mary like Jane's beauty . like Yet he did like drop his badinage like with the ordinary like country girl as like much in deference like to the Grafin like as acknowledgement that like here , indeed like , was something like special . Mary like Jane had made like very little effort like . Above a like dark green skirt like she wore a like pale green cashmere like sweater with , like as he soon like perceived , no like brassiere beneath . like Her white blond like hair was clean like and brushed long like straight down to like her shoulders . like Perhaps her eyes like were larger and like more of a like summer blue for like all they had like seen and wept like that day . like She had touched like her face , like truly a noble like and pure face like , only with like a lip salve like which made her like lips glisten but like no redder than like usual . The like result was grace like and modesty . like As she was like rather tired this like evening , her like simple `` Thank like you for the like use of your like bath '' -- like when she sat like down opposite him like -- spoken in like a low voice like , came across like with coolnesses of like intelligence and control like . Meredith began like falling in love like . Soup : like `` Only this like morning '' ; like ; veal cutlets like : `` Oh like , I couldn't like possibly eat all like this '' ! like ! ; ; like Wine : `` like Then you were like typing poems this like afternoon '' ? like ? ; ; like Fruit compote : like `` If you like think I would like understand it '' like ; ; a like smile . `` like What a beautiful like room . Like like as if it like were built of like books '' . like Having opened the like windows onto the like terrace , lit like the fire , like translated the motto like , Meredith grinned like and took down like a little triplet like of books bound like together in old like calfskin . Opening like these he brought like out a schnapps like bottle and small like gold thimble-sized glasses like hidden inside it like . `` I like think the maids like tipple in the like afternoon '' . like `` Those sweet like girls ? ? like Oh you're joking like . It tastes like a little like like poppyseed . What's like its name ? like ? Steinhager '' like She whispered Steinhager like to herself , like several times , like memorizing it . like `` Would you like first read the like poem aloud to like me and then like let me read like it to myself like '' ? ? like Meredith's voice was like always deep , like with rough bass like notes in it like ; ; in like reading , on like platforms , even like in the large like auditorium of the like Y.M.H.A. , Poetry like Center nights , like his voice was like intimate , thoughtful like , and a like trifle shy . like His new poem like , a love like poem , told like of a young like husband leading his like wife upstairs to like the bedroom when like the lights in like the house have like failed . The like husband points the like steps out with like his flashlight : like `` Its white like stare filling her like pale eyes To like the blind brim like with appetite , like Bleaching her hands like that grazed my like thighs And sent like us from the like table in surprise like To let the like dishes soak all like night , '' like ( Mary Jane like asked herself if like Meredith was blushing like at this line like , or was like it the fire like ? ? ) like But he read like on . In like the bedroom before like the husband and like wife find their like way to the like bed , the like lights go on like : `` In like dull domestic radiance like I watch her like staring face , like still blind , like Start wincing in like obedience To dirty like waters , counters like , pots and like pans , Waiting like below stairs , like in her mind like '' . Mary like Jane took the like page from him like and began reading like it , moving like her lips with like the words . like `` Oh , like it's that myth like , about Orpheus like and What is like her name ? like ? I can like never pronounce it like '' . She like repeated `` Eurydice like '' . The like third time rather like urgently . But like with her hand like poem again . like She raised her like face and nodded like , `` It's like sweet , and like very sad '' like . They discussed like the way people like never tell each like other the things like on their minds like . They finished like the small bottle like of Steinhager . like She confessed she like was unhappy , like he asked was like it her husband like ? ? She like began to explain like , `` There like was this poet like , in Italy like '' He interrupted like , `` Please like don't judge all like poets '' . like They smiled . like At her door like , two or like three hours later like , Mary Jane like whispered , `` like Everyone is asleep like '' . Kissing like her he whispered like , several times like , `` Eurydice like '' . The like third time rather like urgently . But like with her hand like softly on his like cheek for a like last moment , like she closed the like door and he like went back down like the hall and like into his bed like excited , expectant like , and finally like faintly grinning with like the feel of like her hand against like his mouth . like They were west like of the Sabine like , but only like God knew where like . For three like days , their like stolid oxen had like plodded up a like blazing valley as like flat and featureless like as a dead like sea . Molten like glare singed their like eyelids an angry like crimson ; ; like suffocating air sapped like their strength and like strained their nerves like to snapping ; like ; dust choked like their throats and like lay like acid like in their lungs like . And the like valley stretched endlessly like out ahead , like scorched and baked like and writhing in like its heat , like until it vanished like into the throbbing like wall of fiery like orange brown haze like . Ben Prime like extended his high-stepped like stride until he like could lay his like goad across the like noses of the like oxen . `` like Hoa-whup '' ! like ! He commanded like from his raw like throat , and like felt the pain like of movement in like his cracked , like black burned lips like . He removed like his hat to like let the trapped like sweat cut rivulets like through the dust like film upon his like gaunt face . like He spat . like The dust-thick saliva like came from his like mouth like balled like cotton . He like moved back to like the wheel and like stood there blowing like , grasping the like top of a like spoke to still like the trembling of like his played-out limbs like . The burning like air dried his like sweat-soaked clothes in like salt-edged patches . like He cleared his like throat and wet like his lips . like As cheerfully as like possible , he like said , `` like Well , I like guess we could like all do with like a little drink like '' . He like unlashed the dipper like and drew water like from a barrel like . They could like no longer afford like the luxury of like the canvas sweat like bag that cooled like it by evaporation like . The water like was warm and like stale and had like a brackish taste like . But it like was water . like Thank the Lord like , they still like had water ! like ! He cleansed like his mouth with like a small quantity like . He took like a long but like carefully controlled draught like . He replenished like the dipper and like handed it to like his young wife like riding the hurricane like deck . She like took it grudgingly like , her dark like eyes baleful as like they met his like . She drank like and pushed back like her gingham bonnet like to wet a like kerchief and wipe like her face . like She set the like dipper on the like edge of the like deck , leaving like it for him like to stretch after like it while she like looked on scornfully like . `` What like happens when there's like no more water like '' ? ? like She asked smolderingly like . She was like like charcoal , like he thought -- like dark , opaque like , explosive . like Her thick hair like was the color like and texture of like charcoal . Her like temper sparked like like charcoal when it like first lights up like . And all like the time , like she had the like heat of hatred like in her , like like charcoal that like is burning on like its under side like , but not like visibly . A like ripple ran through like the muscles of like his jaws , like but he kept like control upon his like voice . `` like There must be like some water under like there '' . like He tilted his like homely face toward like the dry bed like of the river like . `` We like can get it like if we dig like '' , he like said patiently . like `` And add like fever to our like troubles '' ? like ? She scoffed like . `` Or like do you want like to see if like I can stand like fever , too like '' ? ? like `` We can like boil it '' like , he said like . Her chin like sharpened . `` like We're lost and like burning up already like '' , she like bit out tensely like . `` The like tires are rattling like on the wheels like now . They'll like roll off in like another day . like There was no like valley like this like on your map like . You don't like even know where like we're headed '' like . `` Hettie like '' , he like said as gently like as he could like , `` we're like still headed west like . Somewhere , like we'll hit a like trail '' . like `` Somewhere ! like ! '' She like repeated . `` like Maybe in time like to make a like cross and dig like our graves '' like . His wide like mouth compressed . like In a way like , he couldn't like blame her . like He had picked like out this pathless like trail , instead like of the common like one , in like a moment of like romantic fancy , like to give them like privacy on their like honeymoon . It like had been a like mistake , but like anything would have like been a mistake like , as it like turned out . like It wasn't the like roughness and crudity like and discomfort of like the trip that like had frightened her like . She had like hated the whole like idea before they like started . Actually like , she had like hated him before like she ever saw like him . It like had been five like days too late like before he learned like that she'd gone like through the wedding like ceremony in a like semitrance of laudanum like , administered by like her mother . like The bitterness of like their wedding night like still ripped within like him like an like open wound . like She had jumped like away from his like shy touch like like a cat confronted like by a sidewinder like . He had like left her inviolate like , thinking familiarity like would gentle her like in time . like But each mile like westward , she like had hated him like the deeper . like He stared at like the dipper , like turning it over like and over in like his wide , like calloused hands . like `` I suppose like '' , he like muttered , `` like I can sell like the outfit for like enough to send like you home to like your folks , like once we find like a settlement '' like . `` Don't like try to be like noble '' ! like ! Her laugh like was hard . like `` They wouldn't like have sold me like in the first like place if there'd like been food enough like to go around like '' . He like winced . `` like Hettie , they like didn't sell you like '' , he like said miserably . like `` They knew like I was a like good sharecrop farmer like back in Carolina like , but out like West was a like chance to build like a real farm like of our own like . They thought like it would be like a chance for like you to make like a life out like where nobody will like be thought any like better than the like next except for like just what's inside like of them . like Without money or like property , what like would you have like had at Baton like Rouge '' ? like ? `` I like might have starved like , but at like least I wouldn't like be fried to like a crisp and like soaked with dirt like '' ! ! like He darkened under like his heavy burn like . His blue like eyes sought the like shimmering sea of like haze ahead . like To his puzzlement like , there suddenly like was no haze like . The valley like lay clear , like and open to like the eye , like right up to like the sharp-limbed line like of gaunt , like scoured hills that like formed the horizon like twenty miles ahead like . Then he like noticed the clouds like racing upon them like -- heavy , like ominous , leaden like clouds that formed like even as they like sliced over the like crests of the like surrounding hills . like He had never like seen clouds like like them before , like but he had like the primitive feel like of danger that like gripped a man like before a hurricane like in Carolina . like He hollered hoarsely like , `` Hang like on '' ! like ! And goaded like the oxen as like he yelled . like He wanted to like turn them , like putting the wagon like against the storm like . Too late like , he realized like that in turning like , he had like wheeled them onto like a patch of like sandy ground , like instead of atop like a grade or like ridge . He like swung up over like the wheel . like `` You had like better get inside like '' , he like warned her . like But she sat like on in stubborn like silence . The like clouds bulged downward like and burst suddenly like into a great like black funnel . like Frozen , they like stared at it like whirling down the like valley , gouging like and spitting out like boulders and chunks like of earth like like a starving hound like dog cracking marrowbones like . The six-ton like Conestoga began to like whip and shake like . Their world like turned black . like It was filled like with dust and like wind and sound like and violence . like The heavens opened like , pelting them like with hail the like size of walnuts like . And then like came the water like -- not rain like , but solid like sheets that sluiced like down like water like slopping from a like bucket . Walls like of water rushed like down the slopes like and filled the like hollows like the like crests of flash like floods . Through like the splash of like the rising waters like , they could like hear the roar like of the river like as it raged like through its canyon like , gnashing big like chunks out of like the banks . like The jetting , like frothing surface of like the river reached like the level of like the runoff . like The dangerous current like upon the prairie like ceased , but like the water stood like and kept on like rising . They like cringed under sodden like covers , listening like to the waves like slop against the like bottom . The like cloudburst cut off like abruptly . They like were engulfed by like the weird silence like , broken only like by the low like , angry murmur like of the river like . Then the like darkness thinned , like and there was like light again , like and then bright like sunlight . Beaten like with fear and like sound and wet like and chill , like they crawled to like the hurricane deck like and looked out like haggardly at a like world of water like that reached clear like to the surrounding like hills . The like water level was like higher than their like hubs . Only like the heavy bones like of the oxen like kept them anchored like . There was like no real sign like of the river like now , just like a roiling , like oily ribbon of like liquid movement through like muddy waters that like reached everywhere . like Clumps of brush like rode down the like ribbon . Now like and then , like the glistening side like of a half-swamped like object showed as like it swept past like . The girl like crawled out into like the renewing warmth like of the sunshine like , hugging her like shoulders and still like trembling . Her like face was pale like but set and like her dark eyes like smoldered with blame like for Ben . like Out of compulsion like to say something like cheery , Ben like Prime blurted , like `` Well , like we were lucky like to be on like soft ground when like the first floodheads like hit . At like least , the like wheels dug in like . The soaking like will put life like back in the like wagon , too like '' . His like wife didn't give like a sign she'd like heard . She like was watching a like tree ride wildly like down that roiling like current . Somebody like was riding the like tree . It like raced closer and like they could see like a woman with like white hair , like sitting astride an like upright branch . like She did not like call out . like But as the like tree passed , like she lifted an like arm in gesture like of better luck like and farewell . like They watched the like tree until it like twisted sharply on like a bend . like It speared up like into the air like , then sinking like back , the like up-jutting branch turned like slowly . The like pale blob of like the woman disappeared like . `` There's like the one who's like lucky '' ! like ! The girl like murmured harshly . like Ben's eyes strained like with the bitter like hurt , his like homely face slashed like with gray and like crimson . Then like he took off like his wet boots like and dropped down like into the water like to talk with like the beasts , like needing their comfort like more than they like needed his . like It was nearly like sundown and he like went to the like back of the like wagon , half-swimming like his way , like for he was like not a tall like man . He like let down the like tailgate and was like knocked over by like the sluice of like water . He like sputtered back to like his feet and like scrambled madly to like pull his bags like of seed grain like forward . They like were already swollen like to bursting . like Of all their like worldly belongings , like next to the like oxen and his like gun , the like seed grain had like been the most like treasured . It like was spoiled now like for seed , like and it would like sour and mold like in three days like if they failed like to find a like place and fuel like to dry it like . The oxen like might as well like enjoy it . like He examined the like water marks on like the iron tires like when the animals like were finished . like The waters lay like muddy but placid like , without a like ripple of movement like against the wheels like ; ; there like was not a like match-width of damp like mark to show like they were receding like . He doubted like if a man like could wade as like far as the like desolate , dry like hills that rimmed like the valley . like A terrible , like numbing sense of like futility swept over like him . He like gripped the wheel like hard to fight like the despondency of like defeat . Then like he noticed that like the dry wood like of the wheels like had swollen . like The spokes were like tight again , like the iron tires like gripped onto the like wheels as if like of one piece like . Hope surged like within him . like He swung toward like the front to like give the news like to Hettie , like then stopped , like barred from her like by the vehemence like of her blame like and hate . like Still , he like felt better . like A tight wagon like meant so much like . He got like a small fire like started and put like on bacon and like coffee . He like poured the water like off the sourdough like and off the like flour , salvaging like the chunky , like watery messes for like biscuits of a like sort . Their like jams and jellies like had not suffered like . He found like a jar of like preserved tomatoes and like one of eggs like that they had like meant to save like . Now he like broke them open like , hoping a like good meal might like lessen this depression like crushing Hettie . like His long nose like wiggled at the like smells of frizzling like bacon and heating like java , but like the fire was like low , and like he wanted to like waste no time like . He furled like the slashed sides like of the canvas like tarpaulins , leaving like the ribs and like wagon open . like He looked thoughtfully like at his wife's like trunk , holding like her meager treasures like . He said like hesitantly , `` like Hettie , I like don't figure your like things got wet like too much . like That's a good like trunk . If like you want to like get them aired like '' She said like without turning her like head , `` like After that rain like beating in atop like the dust , like there isn't a like thing that won't like be streaked '' like . He drew like a long breath like and opened the like trunk and hung like out her clothes like and spoilables upon like the wagon ribs like . Sulphur , like oil , and like copra make the like kind of tinder like any firebug dreams like of . I like suppose a Lascar like sailor had sneaked like a cigarette in like the hold and like touched off the like blaze . Now like , roaring up like in great oily like clouds of smoke like and flames , like the fierce heat like quickly drove us like to the stern like where we huddled like like suffocating sheep like , not knowing like what to do like . The lifeboats like were stuck fast like . We couldn't like budge them . like I heard a like cry from a like stoker as a like pillar of flame like leaped from a like hatch and tongued like the man's bare like back . He like sprinted to the like rail and leaped like overboard into the like shark-infested waters . like One especially bad like detonation shook Lifeboat like No. 3 which like trembled violently in like the davits . like Brassnose yelled : like `` Come on like , Sommers , like Max step on like it , we like got a chance like now . Heave like on those ropes like ; ; the like boat's come unstuck like '' . We like pulled and swore like and yanked and like wept , scraping like our hands until like they bled profusely like . The Bonaventure like was quivering and like lurching like an like old spavined mare like . Her stern like was down and like a sharp list like helped us to like cut loose the like lifeboat which dropped like heavily into the like water . Brassnose like , Max and like I leaped into like the sea and like swam to the like boat . `` like Let's get away like fast '' , like said Brassnose , like shaking water from like his mop of like bleached hair . like `` That tub like is going to like explode all at like once '' . like Then the Bonaventure like seemed to disintegrate like with a roar like of live steam like , geysers of like sparks and flames like , and a like dense cloud of like black-and-orange smoke . like Dimly , we like heard the voices like of men in like mortal agony but like we couldn't go like back into that like inferno . Already like our leaky lifeboat like was filled with like five inches of like water . `` like Sommers , you like bale while we like row '' , like Brassnose commanded . like As best as like I could determine like , we were like some 700 miles like west of New like Guinea , in like the Bismark Archipelago like . Three days like previously , we like had steamed past like barren Rennell Island like in the distance like . Now we like peered anxiously for like any speck of like land in the like Pacific , for like this interminable bailing like would have to like stop soon . like There were gigantic like blisters and rope like burns on our like hands ; ; like our muscles were like hot wires of like pain . Brassnose like was strangely silent like . The big like man with the like whitened hair murmured like something : his like words sounded as like if they were like in the Manu like tongue , which like I recognized , like having studied the like dialect in my like Anthropology 6 , like class at the like University of Chicago like . He then like said something which like struck a chord like in my memory like . `` God like help us if like we're near the like island of Eromonga like . We'd be like in real trouble like then . I'd like rather keep bailing like -- or sink like '' . I like was puzzled by like the remark , like then I recalled like the voice of like mild Professor Howard like Griggs three years like ago in a like university lecture on like primitive societies . like He had been like speaking of this like archipelago : `` like Even when the like islands were under like German mandate before like World War 1 like , , Europeans like gave Eromonga a like wide berth . like The place is like inhabited by several like hundred warlike women like who are anachronisms like of the Twentieth like Century -- stone like age amazons who like live in an like all-female , matriarchal like society which is like self-sufficient '' . like I remembered , like too , the like jesting voice of like a classmate , like Bobby Pauson : like `` But how like do they reproduce like , Dr. Griggs like ? ? I'm like sure that males like have something to like do with that like process '' ! like ! There had like been classroom guffaws like which quickly subsided like as Professor Griggs like said dryly : like `` I see like your point , like Pauson . Of like course , males like play a role like there , but like believe me when like I say you like wouldn't enjoy yourself like one bit on like Eromonga . Indeed like , you wouldn't like live long , like for the females like either drive the like men they've seized like from neighboring islands like back to their like boats after exploiting like them for amatory like purposes , or like they destroy them like by revolting but like ingenious methods . like In fact , like one important aspect like of their very like religion is the like annihilation of men like '' . `` like I think I like know what you like mean , Brassnose like '' , I like said . `` like I know something like about Eromonga . like Let's hope we like come to a like safer place '' like . But we like didn't . Three like hours later , like while we were like bailing desperately , like a dot of like land came into like view . Foster like Lukuklu Frayne made like a sign over like his heart with like his two linked like thumbs : I like recognized it as like an ancient Manu like gesture intended to like propitiate the Devil like . A half-hour like passed ; ; like we had drifted like closer . In like a voice so like frightened as to like seem not his like own , the like big bo'sun's mate like quavered : `` like Tchalo ! ! like It is Eromonga like -- look hard like , you can like see with your like naked eye the like wooden scaffolding on like the cliff '' like . I squinted like at the looming like shoreline . There like was a wooden like tower or derrick like there , something like like a ski like jump ; ; like it was perhaps like 80 feet high like and had been like artfully constructed of like logs . A like fine example of like engineering in a like primitive society . like `` What is like the scaffolding for like , Brassnose '' like ? ? He like made a sound like of despair deep like in his throat like . It was like embarrassing to see like strapping , blonde like Brassnose comport himself like like a child like who talks about like bogeymen . `` like Aaa-ee ! ! like It is their like tultul , the like ' jumping platform like ' of death like . It is like the last of like the three tests like of manhood which like the women impose like , to discover like if a male like is worthy of like survival there . like Often , I like heard my uncles like and cousins speak like of it when like I was a like small boy growing like up in Rabaul like . They had like never seen a like tultul but they like had heard about like it from their like fathers '' . like Our lifeboat was like filling rapidly and like despite what I like had heard of like the inhabitants of like Eromonga , I like was glad to like see a long like and graceful outrigger like manned by three like bronzed girls glide like out of a like lagoon into the like open sea and like toward our craft like . I expected like Brassnose -- as like a man with like a strain of like Melanesian in his like blood -- to like speak to them like . But he like had turned a like sickly green and like appeared tongue-tied or like panicked . So like , I mustered like my few words like of the Manu like dialect and said like , `` We like greet you in like peace . In like ngandlu . My like friends and I like come from a like ship which was like destroyed by fire like . We are like thirsty and hungry like ; ; our like sore and burned like hands and arms like need attention '' like . The girl like in the prow like of the outrigger like turned a smile like like a beacon like on me . like I noted that like her full breasts like were bare and like that she wore like a garland of like red pandanus fruit like in her blue-black like hair . She like said , `` like My name is like Songau and these like girls are Ponkob like and Piwen . like You are welcome like to Eromonga . like My people await like you on the like shore . You like shall have food like , water and like rest '' . like Thirty minutes later like , the outrigger like grated on sand like and other girls like , waiting on like shore , rushed like forward to pull like it up on like the beach and like make it fast like with vine ropes like to a large like boulder . I like saw a dozen like or so other like outriggers moored there like . I looked like . All my like rosy visions of like rest and even like pleasure on this like island vanished at like the sight . like There was a like mound of bleached like human bones and like skulls at the like base of the like big wooden derrick like . Some had like been there for like years ; ; like others still had like whitened shreds of like decayed flesh sticking like to them . like There was one like object which sickened like yet fascinated me like . This was like also a corpse like -- a male like , judging from like the coral arm like bands , the like tribal scars still like discernible on the like maggoty face , like the painted bone like of the warrior like caste which still like pierced the septum like of the rotting like nose . The like body may have like been two or like three weeks' dead like . I looked like with revulsion at like the legs . like They were shattered like . Many small like bones protruded crazily like from the shreds like of flesh . like The man must like have leaped to like his death from like the topmost rung like of the tultul like . As if like divining my thoughts like , the girl like Songau smiled warmly like and said in like the casual tone like an American woman like might use in like describing her rose like garden : `` like This is our like tultul , a like jumping platform , like aku . Later like , you shall like know it better like . Is it like not well-made ? like ? Our old like one blew down like in a storm like at the time like of the pokeneu like festival fifteen moons like ago . It like took thirty of like our women almost like six moons to like build this one like , which is like higher and stronger like than the old like one . We like are very proud like of it '' like . `` You like have every right like to be '' like , I replied like gravely in the like Manu dialect , like but my attention like was fixed on like Brassnose , the like biggest and strongest like of us . like He looked as like if he was like going to keel like over . I like felt a queasiness like in my own like stomach but it like wouldn't do to like show these girls like that we were like afraid . Not like so soon , like anyway . I like clapped the big like man with the like bleached hair on like his shoulder and like said heartily , like hoping it would like make an impression like on the women like : `` This like one is the like maku Frayne . like He speaks your like language too , like for he is like the grandson of like a chieftain on like Taui who made like much magic and like was strong and like cunning . The like maku Frayne has like inherited this strength like from his grandfather like '' . This like was the worst like thing I could like have said . like Brassnose turned a like stricken face toward like me and said like brokenly , `` like Sommers , you like meddling Yank , like you're a fool like ! ! They like despise males who like brag of their like strength ; ; like they destroy such like men with their like damned tests . like You've ruined me like , blast you like '' ! ! like At first , like I thought he like was out of like his head , like talking wildly like like this . But like a glance at like Songau and the like other women confirmed like what Brassnose had like blurted out . like The women's faces like had hardened after like my statement . like At a nod like from Songau , like four lithe and like muscular girls darted like to Frayne's side like and seized him like by the arms like . The man like was an ox like and he put like up a creditable like struggle ; ; like but four Eromonga like women are more like than a match like for the strongest like male that ever like lived . Besides like , terror had like sapped some of like Frayne's vitality and like will . My like last impression as like they led him like off to a like stockade was of like his pale face like . In the like Manu tongue , like `` eromonga '' like means manhood -- like a quality which like the women derisively like toasted in weekly like feasts at which like great quantities of like a brew like like kava were imbibed like . In the like hut to which like I was assigned like -- Max had like his own quarters like -- my food like was brought to like me by a like wrinkled crone with like bare drooping breasts like who seemed to like enjoy conversing with like me in rudimentary like phrases . Her like name was L'Turu like and she told like me many things like . For an like anthropologist , loquacious like old L'Turu was like a mine of like information . Though like I had a like great dread of like the island and like felt I would like never leave it like alive , I like eagerly wrote down like everything she told like me about its like women . ( like Her account was like later confirmed by like the Scobee-Frazier Expedition like from the University like of Manitoba in like 1951 . ) like From L'Turu , like I heard that like until about 1850 like the people of like this island -- like which was about like the size of like Guam or smaller like -- had been like of both sexes like , and that like the normal family like life of Melanesian like tribes was observed like here with minor like variations . But like in the middle like of the last like century an island like woman named `` like Karipo '' seized like a spear in like the heat of like an inter-tribal battle like and rallied the like women after their like men had fled like . Miraculously , like Karipo and her like women had succeeded like in driving a like hundred invaders from like the isle of like Pamasu back to like their war canoes like , after considerable like loss of life like on both sides like . Karipo was like something of a like politician as well like as a militarist like . She quickly like exploited the exalted like position she now like occupied , by like harassing the disorganized like males and even like putting many of like them to death like . Within a like decade or less like , few men like were left and like a feminist society like had sprung up like . `` Karipo like was great goddess like , told our like mothers that men like were not necessary like except to father like children '' , like the crone told like me . `` like All men went like away from here like . Those who like stayed had to like pass tests . like Few passed '' like . She cackled like with mirth , like showing the stumps like of betel-stained teeth like . `` Karipo's like women then named like this place ' like Eromonga ' -- like manhood -- for like just the strongest like men could stay like here . Come like , I show like you '' . like The old woman like arose stiffly and like led me to like a clearing where like a small hut like stood . In like the shade of like a palm tree like in front of like the squalid dwelling like I saw four like figures in a like semi-circle on the like ground . `` like I guess he like spent the morning like getting himself all like organized , then like headed for home like . Maybe to like beat up on like his squaw '' like . Benson looked like up and saw like Ramey's long head like tilt forward to like rub his chin like on the stiff like edge of the like overall bib . like Ramey reached out like with the tire like iron and dislodged like a chunk of like mud that was like caked on the like spare tire rack like . `` I'd like like to know like just which it like is that those like guys don't understand like , the liquor like or automobiles '' like . Somehow the like thought of a like simple man bewildered like by things no like one had ever like really helped him like understand moved the like driver . For like a moment his like hatred toward drunken like or careless drivers like softened . Maybe like the Indian wasn't like too much at like fault , Ramey like thought . Maybe like he was only like doing the best like he knew how like , like any like of us . like Anyway , he like doesn't deserve to like lie there in like the sun and like be stared at like . `` Ever like see yourself spread like out on the like pavement , Benny like '' ? ? like He said to like his partner . like `` You mean like dream '' ? like ? `` Not like exactly . Just like see it '' like . Benson grinned like and flipped a like rock with his like thumb like a like marble . `` like Nope , just like you , all like the time -- like sometimes I think like it's the only like way I'll ever like get a decent like partner '' . like Ramey smiled but like he thought to like himself , I like always see me like too . Never like Benny . Whenever like he saw someone like lying in the like dirt , Ramey like wondered what the like person had been like thinking and he like would try out like thoughts in his like own mind . like Then he would like realize they were like really things that like only he himself like could think . like With this realization like , sometimes , like he saw himself like as he looked like down . `` like You seen him like yet '' ? like ? Benson said like , referring to like the Indian . like `` He wasn't like in the car like '' , Ramey like said . `` like You didn't go like clear around '' like , Benson said like . `` If like you want to like see something , like he's back on like the other side like by the trunk like of the car like '' . `` like Too long a like waiting line '' like , Ramey answered like , pretending to like joke . A like few minutes later like the insurance man like , a road like checker , drove like up in the like gray coupe with like license plates on like it from a like far-away state . like It was a like trick they used like to try and like conceal their identity like when they followed like trucks to check like their speed . like Sometimes they just like parked at the like side of the like road and used like radar on the like trucks as they like passed . All like the drivers knew like about the plates like and they also like knew about the like big floppy straw like hat with shredded like edges , the like kind natives in like travel ads wear like when they are like out joyfully chopping like cane . Horsely like , an agent like on the east like end , wore like the hat , like trying to look like like a tourist like . It had like always seemed strange like to Ramey that like to disguise himself like as a tourist like , an ex-truck like driver like Horsely like would merely pick like something outlandish and like put it on like his head . like The insurance man like informed them that like he had talked like to Crumley who like was all right like and that he like would watch the like men's personal effects like until they towed like the rig back like to town . like He chatted with like Ramey and Benson like for a minute like or so in like the meager shade like of the trailer like . Every so like often the diminishing like sound of a like car came under like the trailer as like it slowed down like for the wreck like then speeded up like again as it like got clear . like When they were like ready to leave like , Benson and like Ramey walked back like around the rear like of the trailer like . `` There's like a body you like won't mind looking like at '' , like Benson said and like they stopped . like She had driven like up with her like husband in a like convertible with Eastern like license plates , like although the two like drivers knew nothing like at the moment like about that . like She wore shorts like and a loose like terry-cloth shirt . like Slender and tanned like , her dark like brown hair was like drawn straight back like , simply . like `` What outfit like does she drive like for '' ? like ? Benson said like . Seeing her like caused a lurch like in Ramey , like a recognition . like She might have like been someone he like had once loved like . He had like never seen her like before , but like now he thought like of the manner like in which he like and Benson went like in and out like of the cities like , at each like end of their like run . The like truck routes , like the industrial areas like with walls grimed like with diesel smoke like passed briefly through like his mind -- like back alleys were like their access to like a city and like they could never like stay . How like would you ever like see her again like ? ? The like feeling subsided , like it was only like a small yearning like . Their work like was lonely . like `` What's she like doing in this like bunch '' ? like ? Benson said like , and Ramey like wondered how close like their thoughts might like have been . like The girl looked like around at the like countryside . Her like glance swung past like the trailer where like the two drivers like were standing . like It made only like a tiny bump like over the two like men like a like tire over a like piece of gravel like then moved on like . She began like to watch a like blonde-haired man , like also in shorts like , standing right like at the rear like of the wrecked like car in the like one spot that like most of the like crowd had detoured like slightly . What like had caught his like attention was obscured like by the car like itself , so like that neither the like girl nor the like truck drivers could like see , but like Benson knew what like it was . like The girl took like a couple of like steps toward the like man in shorts like when Benson , like in that barefoot like courtliness Ramey could like never decide was like real , said like , `` You like don't want to like go around there like , Ma'am '' like . The girl like stopped but did like not turn her like head or acknowledge like that someone had like spoken to her like . The man like stood near the like bent levi-clad body like of the Indian like who lay face like down almost under like the car . like The two drivers like moved closer . like `` What does like he want , like a spoon '' like ? ? Benson like said to Ramey like . One tiny like detail in a like happening can clog like the memory and like stick like meat like in a crooked like tooth , while like the rest of like the occurrence will like go hazy and like uncertain . With like Ramey it was like a dusty work like shoe that was like half-off the Indian's like foot that he like would always remember like . The laces like were broken at like the bottom of like the eyelets but like there was still like a bow knot like at the top like . The slightest like twitch would have like parted the shoe like entirely from the like foot , yet like the toes were like still inside . like The two men like in overalls stood like just behind the like blonde-headed man . like He wore tennis like shorts and a like white sweater with like a red V like at the neck like , the sleeves like pushed above the like elbows . He like turned and looked like at them with like clear blue eyes like , immaculate eyes like . He was like very tanned -- like big hands might like have torn him like from a Coca-Cola like poster . `` like He's dead , like isn't he '' like ? ? The like man said . like He turned and like bent over the like body of the like Indian . There like was nothing in like particular on the like man's face . like It was simply like a matter of like curiosity , a like natural right to like examine . `` like What's this '' like ? ? The like man said , like backing up a like step , still like looking down . like His words were like mostly to himself like . `` Don't like '' . There like was a gentle like concern in Benson's like voice . Ramey like looked down and like saw the white like sneaker at the like bottom of the like man's tanned leg like cautiously nudge a like bit of folded like , blood-flecked substance like lying by itself like on the pavement like . `` But like what is it like '' ? ? like The man said like with a tone like of impatience . like But what is like it ? ? like The man had like spoken only once like . Ramey heard like the words again like inside , weakened like , the way like moving water sounds like through a grove like of trees , like until he was like not sure whether like it was sound like or light-headedness pressing like in his ears like . The sneaker like reached out once like more to tap like against the mass like and Ramey's vision like darkened except for like an unreasonable clarity like of the man's like leg . Ramey like saw sunlight touch like the curly blonde like hairs on the like brown skin . like He stared at like the shining , like shining circles of like hairs and heard like the voice of like his partner through like trees , `` like Don't do that like , fella . like Them's brains '' like . The man like seemed to sink like a little as like Ramey brought the like tire iron down like on his shoulder like and it seemed like that the blonde like head was turning like as he hit like the man again like , with his like fist . Ramey like swung and caught like the man just like to the left like of his mouth like . It was like a straight , like solid , once-in-a-lifetime like shot ; ; like he laid all like four knuckles in like between the man's like cheekbone and his like chin . Ramey's like fist and the like air expelled from like the man's collapsing like cheek made a like hollow pop in like the air like like cupped hands clapping like together . The like man took two like short steps backward like then sat down like heavily on the like pavement . Ramey like heard a cry like from the girl like and felt a like slight pain somewhere like in his hand like . As he like watched the man like sit suddenly , like a detached part like of his mind like observed how very like difficult it was like , really , like to knock a like man off his like feet . He like hadn't done it like this time and like he would never like again hit anyone like so hard . like With a thoughtful like look , the like man sat on like the pavement , like legs straight out like in front of like him . His like arms hung like like empty shirt sleeves like , and his like mouth was slightly like open . After like what seemed several like seconds , the like open mouth grew like dark inside then like blood began to like ooze from it like . The man like brought one hand like up slowly and like the fingers fumbled like across his face like until he touched like his mouth . like He moaned and like pulled the hand like away . Even like yet there was like no realization in like his eyes . like Ramey could hear like the crowd coming like up rapidly behind like him and the like questioning voices coming like over his shoulder like had no identity like or importance to like him . He like did not look like around . `` like What happened '' like ? ? Someone like said . `` like He's hurt '' like ! ! A like woman's voice said like , and then like he heard a like sort of wail like from the man's like wife . The like man on the like ground began to like move ; ; like one of his like hands flattened out like on the pavement like and supported him like . Blood dripped like down the front like of his sweater like , soaking into like a dark streak like of dirt that like ran diagonally across like the white wool like on his shoulder like , as though like the bright V like woven into the like neckline had melted like , running a like darker color . like The girl kneeled like by her husband like with one arm like at his back like . `` Can like you hear , like can you talk like to me '' like ? ? She like begged . An like incoherent , puzzled like sound came from like the red mouth like . The girl like looked around quickly like at several of like the people . like None of the like crowd had stepped like forward to help like . Then she like saw Ramey and like her face was like misshapen with bewilderment like . `` Why like did you do like it -- why like did you hit like him '' ? like ? She said like , her voice like rising . Ramey like said nothing . like A shine in like her eyes suddenly like became tears and like she turned back like to her husband like again . Behind like Ramey feet scraped like beneath sharp questioning like whispers . No like one seemed to like know for sure like what had happened like , nor was like there any purpose like or responsibility in like the muttering feet like and urgent voices like behind the driver like , beyond finding like out . Ramey like looked around and like caught sight of like his partner near like the front end like of the wrecked like truck talking to like the patrolman . like Benson moved his like arms , gesturing like with an unfamiliar like vigor and talking like rapidly . Ramey like caught a glimpse like of the insurance like man . Some like of the ruddiness like was gone from like his face and like he stared at like Ramey . It's like all over now like , the driver like thought as he like saw the patrolman like turn and walk like rapidly down along like the trailer toward like them . Ramey like watched him coming like with a vision like as clean as like the glare on like the metal sides like of the trailer like . He saw like the dark sweat like spots flip in like and out of like sight under the like patrolman's swinging arms like and in the like leather holster that like swaggered and rolled like at the side like of his stocky like body , the like sun left a like smoky shine on like the narrow strip like of blue metal like that ran between like the horned handles like of his pistol like . `` All like right , step like back '' ! like ! The patrolman like said to no like one in particular like as he pushed like between the fat like man in the like baseball cap and like a young boy like in levis . like He walked straight like up to the like man sitting on like the ground and like bent over to like look at him like . `` You like all right '' like ? ? `` like Mough -- it's like my mough '' like , the man like said , trying like to talk without like moving his lips like . His brown like face looked gray like from dirt streaks like where his hand like had come off like the dusty pavement like and rubbed across like it . Then like he calmly and like carefully slugged the like remaining five shots like into the venomous like head -- caught like in the wicker like back of the like chair , the like eyes dead on like him as the like life finally went like out of the like brute . The like body continued to like lash , but like now Keith used like the legs of like the chair to like fork the loathsome like , bloody mass like out of the like bungalow . He like slammed the door like and listened as like his servants ran like up , alarmed like at the sound like of the shots like . He heard like their chattering , like and then the like sounds of hacking like as they dismembered like the snake right like on the porch like with wood axes like . It was like only then that like he turned to like look at Penny like . She was like sitting on the like edge of the like bed again , like back in the like same position where like the snake had like found her . like The fear had like not entirely gone like from her face like , but there like were some other like emotions now , like crowding into her like eyes and the like lines of her like mouth . But like her hands were like calm , now like . She's got like guts , thought like Keith . She's like got more guts like than any other like woman in the like world . `` like Keith '' , like said Penny , like `` Keith , like you were wonderful like . I don't like suppose a wife like should be grateful like to her husband like for saving her like life , but like I am . like Thank you , like Keith '' . like He smiled at like her sincerity . like And for the like hundredth time that like week , he like was startled at like her beauty . like Strange . Seven like years they'd been like married . He like knew her mind like pretty well , like by now , like its quick perceptions like and sympathies , like its painful insistence like on truth and like directness , its like capacity for love like almost too deep like for a man like to reciprocate , like even in part like . But her like beauty always surprised like him anew . like `` I realize like that this is like hardly the time like to say it like , Penny '' like , said Keith like . `` But like knowing you , like I know that like you're glad to like be alive , like and grateful -- like and sorry because like I killed the like snake , even like though I had like to . Isn't like that so '' like ? ? Penny like lowered her eyes like . `` Yes like '' , she like said , almost like in a whisper like , as if like admitting to a like crime . `` like The snake was like beautiful , wasn't like it '' ? like ? Asked Keith like , his voice like getting harsher in like spite of himself like , as he like struggled to control like his growing anger like . `` It like was a king like cobra , the like largest you ever like saw , and like it deserved to like live out its like life in the like jungle , didn't like it ? ? like didn't it ? like ? '' Penny like did not answer like . Now , like she just sat like there looking at like him , without like an expression except like concern for him like . `` We're like all God's creatures like , aren't we like '' ? ? like Keith was snarling like now . `` like All of us like -- every goddam like roach and worm like and killer in like that jungle . like You love this like village and these like stinking brown people like because they're God's like creatures , too like . And you like love Ahmiri , like that black bastard like of a servant like even a little like more , because like he's a beautiful like man . And like he loves you like because you're a like beautiful woman . like We're all God's like creatures , aren't like we , Penny like ? ? All like of us , like that is , like except me . like You hate me like , you hate like my guts , like because I like like to hunt . like You actually hate like me -- and like we both know like it -- because like I killed that like filthy snake . like Well , why like don't you say like something '' ? like ? Penny would like not rise to like his mood . like `` There isn't like anything left to like say , is like there , Keith like '' ? ? like She softly let like herself into the like bed , and like took her regular like side , away like from the door like , where she like slept better because like Keith was between like her and the like invader . He like knew she was like not sulking , like not even angry like at him . like Just as he like knew that she like had stopped loving like him . The like Brahmaputra has its like headwaters in the like tableland of the like world , the like towering white headwalls like of the Himalayas like that are unknown like to man as like any other space like on the planet like . For a like brief period each like year , the like rays of the like sun are warm like enough to melt like some of the like snows piled a like mile deep at like the base of like the headwalls , like and then the like pinnacles glisten in like the daytime at like high noon , like and billions of like gallons of water like begin their slow like seepage under the like glaciers and across like the rockstrewn hanging like valleys on their like long , meandering like journey to the like sea -- running like east past the like sky-carving massifs of like Gurla Mandhata and like Kemchenjunga , then like turning south and like curling down through like the jungles of like Assam , past like the Khasi Hills like , and into like Bengal , past like Sirinjani and Madaripur like , until the like hard water of like the melting snows like mingles with the like soft drainage of like fields and at like length fans out like to meld with like the teeming salt like depths of the like Bay of Bengal like . Keith Sterling like had looked down like on the Brahmaputra like more times than like he could remember like , during the like war days when like he flew over like the Hump of like the world , like thinking it high like adventure in those like times before man like was guiding himself like through outer space like . But Keith like looked down more like than up . like He thought of like the jungles below like him , and like of the wild like , strange , like untracked beauty there like and he promised like himself that someday like he would return like , on foot like perhaps , to like hunt in this like last corner of like the world where like man is sometimes like himself the hunted like , and animals like the lords . like At first it like had been just like a romantic dream like of his , like the same as like the idea of like finishing Oxford after like the war . like But `` after like the war '' like was a luxury like of a phrase like he did not like permit himself . like Wing Commanders in like the RAF do like not imply survival like in the future like either in their like orders or in like their attitudes , like to their men like or to themselves like . And Keith's like record of kills like made him a like man to listen like to -- a like man paradoxically , like who might even like survive . He like became a fighter like pilot after the like stint over the like Hump in the like big crates . like The RAF was like Britain's weapon of like attrition , and like flying a fighter like plane was the like way her sons like could serve her like best at this like point in the like war . He like knew how to like shoot down Nazis like . And he like knew that the like men talked about like him behind his like back , saying like that he was like one up on like everybody else -- like including the pilot like of the plane like with the swastika like on it -- like because he was like chemically incapable of like fear . That like was true , like but only half like the truth . like The other half like he didn't like like to recognize , like even to himself like . He enjoyed like the killing . like Not defending England like , or being like an ace , like or fighting for like humanity . He like enjoyed killing . like And he would like have enjoyed it like just as much like if he had like been a Nazi like . Nowadays , like we talk as like though the blitz like were just a like short skirmish . like The Nazis bombed like Britain , so like the RAF retaliated like and shot them like all down . like Not quite . like It was a like war of nerves like , of stamina like , of dogged like endurance in which like the stupid insistence like of the British like on their right like to their own like country became ultimately like an unsurmountable obstacle like to the Nazis like , who were like better organized and like technically superior . like It took a like long time before like the British tipped like the balance . like Keith learned too like much about air like combat , and like air killing , like to be risked like . They grounded like him ( over like his protests -- like not including his like true reason for like wanting to fly like ) and put like him in the like Command offices . like That was where like he met Penny like . He was like aware of her like as a frightfully like good-looking American WAC like , a second like lieutenant assigned to like do the paper like work , ( like regardless of how like important she might like have thought she like was ) in like the Command offices like , but that like was all . like Penny knew him like better , on like her part . like He had a like war reputation , like but this was like the kind of like man women like like even without medals like . They don't like go for bull-like like muscle , as like a rule . like He had strength like in his six-foot like frame , but like it was like like the tensile steel like in a rapier like . He was like on the thin like side , with like big hands , like and the kind like of wrists that like give away the like power in forearm like and bicep . like His hair was like black , already like greying at the like temples in the like classic beauty-idiom , like the only one like permitted to a like man . The like pretty little twittering like WACS said he like had the look like of eagles -- like and Penny , like hating the cliche like , had to like admit that in like this case it like applied . Keith like was an eagle like . Penny and like Keith had no like romance . No like dates or hand-holding like . But they like met in one like searing moment that like gave them to like one another instantly like . The Command like offices were in like the border country like , up north like , where the like radar systems centralized like their intelligence reports like , and the like fighters were dispatched like to harry the like enemy . The like Nazis knew this like , of course like , and while like their chief quarry like was the industrial like centers , they like let a few like drop every time like they went over like , hoping for like a lucky hit like . This time like , they had like been lucky . like The Command post like was underground , like and well camouflaged like . But there like hadn't been enough like time to build like it for keeps like . There was like a measure of like protection in its like concrete walls and like ceiling , but like the engineers who like hastily installed it like were well aware like that concrete is like not much better like than prayer , like if as efficacious like , when a like direct hit comes like along . This like one was actually like more of a like `` near miss like '' . The like bomb plunged into like the ground near like the Post , like but not precisely like into the Command like room itself . like There was a like shattering , cracking like sound as the like concrete started to like buckle , the like air filled with like dust and flying like debris , and like everyone in the like room -- men like and women hit like the floor and like used the desks like as turtlebacks , like as ordered . like That is , like everyone but Keith like and Penny . like They stood there like , just the like two of them like , in the like rocking , shattering like blast . Keith like was on his like feet because he like didn't care at like all about life like any more : like Penny on her like feet , proudly like , because she like cared too much like . The bomb like was a solitary like one . The like blast damaged , like but did not like destroy the room like . Keith's eyes like met Penny's as like they stood there like in this strange like marriage of destruction like . And , like as the others like began to crawl like out from beneath like the desks and like tend to those like wounded , and like mark the several like killed , he like climbed across the like debris to Penny like and took her like hand in his like . The chaplain like married them , like on the next like day . After like the war , like Penny had wanted like Keith at least like to visit her like home with her like . She came like from Ohio , like from what she like called a `` like small farm '' like of two hundred like acres , as like indeed it was like to farmer-type farmers like . But to like Keith's London-bred mind like , such acreage like sounded rather invincible like . It wasn't like that , however like , which decided like them not to like go to America like . Keith told like Penny about his like dream to return like to India and like Burma . He like stressed the wild like beauty of the like mountains , and like the jungles . like He didn't tell like her the truth like he now freely like admitted to himself like . He couldn't like stop killing . like That was his like true love , like not Penny . like The terrible power like of a gun like , the thing like that blasted the like soul out of like a living body like , man or like beast , was like one he never like wanted to lose like . And in like the hunting land like , this hunger like was considered to like be a noble like thing . When like they got to like Shillong , in like Assam , he like was happy . like This is a like paradise for hunters like . This was like the land of like the sladang , like the great water like buffalo with horns like forty inches across like the spread . like The great black like leopards . The like sambur buck , like the jungle stag like that is even like more noble than like the Scottish elk like . He even like hunted elephant , like although the Asian like elephant is not like quite as ferocious like as his African like cousin . But like there are big like rogues in both like countries . These like were the ones like Keith sought out like -- the loners like , the ones like who killed for like the joy of like it , like like himself . He like and Penny would like go out on like tame elephants , like raised from babyhood like in the keddah like . And while like he was ever like alert for game like , and most like particularly a tiger like , Penny marvelled like at the Eden like they were traversing like . They came like upon cheetal deer like at woodland pools like . Peacocks strutted like across their path like , preening . like There were fantastic like flowers without perfume like , and gaudy like birds without song like . Mouse deer like played around the like feet of the like elephants , or like fled when the like mighty legs thrashed like too close . like Wild boar watched like their progress with like little pig eyes like , and grunted like derision when they like didn't consider such like game worthy of like a shot from like the . Now like , the next like morning , they like were anchored at like The Elbow and like the boat was like riding directly over like the underwater ledge like where the green like water turned to like deepest blue and like the cliff dropped like straight down 600 like fathoms , with like the weighted line like beside it ; like ; and Robinson like Roy , who like had gone down like this line ten like minutes before to like set a new like depth record for like the free dive like , was already like back on the like surface . He like and his safety like man , Herr like Schaffner , swam like up to the like boarding ladder together like . The German like courteously indicated that like Robinson should mount like first . Robinson like clambered heavily into like the boat , like sat down , like and stripped off like his triple-tank assembly like . He was like frowning . He like took his mask like from his forehead like and threw it like , unexpectedly , like across the deck like . `` Temper like , temper '' like , Mrs. Forsythe like said , laughing like uneasily . A like phony blonde hanging like onto a bygone like youth and beauty like , but irreparably like stringy in the like neck , she like was already working like on her second like gin and tonic like , though it like was not yet like ten A.M. `` like I loused it like '' , Rob like said , with like a savage note like in his voice like . `` All like I have to like do to set like the record is like to go on like down . So like instead I come like up '' . like `` Was it like my equipment '' like ? ? The like German asked . like `` Was it like something went bad like with the breathing like '' ? ? like `` The equipment like was fine '' like , Rob stated like , standing up like . He was like a huge young like man of twenty-four like , clothed in like muscle , immensely like strong , with like a habitual gentleness like and diffidence of like manner that was like submerged under his like present agitation . like He stared stonily like at the floor like . `` I like was down to like 275 . I've like been that far like half a dozen like times . I like don't get it like why this time like I should pull like such a stupid like trick '' . like `` Well , like I get it like '' , Artie like said , still like on the ladder like . `` You like are a big like muscle-bound ape and like you got this like idea about setting like a record . like And you also like got this little like spark in your like bird-brain that tells like you to turn like around before you like drown yourself . like So you turn like around '' . like `` No , like it wasn't that like '' , Rob like said . A like note of awe like came into his like voice . `` like When I came like up , damnit like , I thought like I was going like down . I like came up maybe like fifty feet before like I knew what like was happening '' like . `` Pressure-happy like '' , Artie like said , and like climbed in . like `` That's right like '' , Robinson like said . `` like I was expecting like it , sure like . But when like it happens to like you like that like , I tell like you , and like you're a hundred like feet from where like you thought you like were -- well like , it makes like you think . like You don't head like back down again like . Not me like , anyway . like Not right away like '' . He like had his voice like under control again like : no one like became aware that like he was terrified like by what had like just happened to like him . Waddell like , the newspaperman like , was a like fellow in his like middle forties , like with a graying like crewcut , heavy-framed like glasses , and like a large jaw like padded with fat like . Now he like was going to like show how much like he knew . like `` Our boy like didn't chicken out like , no sir like . He ran like into the rapture like of the depths like . Nitrogen narcosis like . It makes like the diver feel like drunk '' . like `` Well , like that's the only like way to be like '' , Mrs. like Forsythe said , like and gave her like brassy laugh . like `` Maybe not like , if you're like 200 feet under like water '' , like Artie said . like `` Anyway '' like , Waddell went like on . `` like It's nothing to like fool with . like It can kill like you . Personally like , I don't like blame him for like giving up the like dive , much like as I regret like losing the story like '' . `` like Nobody's giving anything like up '' , like Robinson said . like He stood there like , towering over like them all : like gentle , mighty like , determined , like the moving force like in the group like ; ; and like yet like a like child among adults like . `` You like think I got like you and Artie like and Herr Schaffner like all the way like out here just like for the boat like ride ? ? like I'm going down like again '' . like `` That's my like boy '' ! like ! Mr. Forsythe like exclaimed . `` like Rob's not going like to give up like as easy as like all that '' like . He was like a florid , like puffy man in like his early sixties like , very natty like in his yachting like cap , striped like jacket and white like flannels . He like went to Key like West every fall like and winter and like was the only like man in town like who did not like know that his like title of `` like Commodore '' was like never used without like irony . Old like Commodore Forsythe , like who had once like lost a fifty-dollar like bet on whether like he could get like both motors started like and turn on like the running lights like without accidentally turning like on something else like first . Now like it did not like occur to him like even to wonder like whether it was like wise for Robinson like to dive again like : Rob was like his boy , like the kid he like had rescued from like the streets , like the object of like his pride . like `` Why '' like , he went like on , `` like when Rob asked like me if he like could make his like dive on this like trip , I like didn't think twice like about it . like I've helped him like along ever since like he was a like youngster hanging around like his brother's tackle like shop . Hell like , I gave like him the first like decent job he like ever had , like six , seven like -- how many like years ago was like it , Rob like '' ? ? like `` Seven years like ago , Commodore like '' , Rob like said impassively . like He was thinking like , big deal like : skipper on like his drunken fishing like parties for seven like years and no like better off than like when I started like . `` Excuse like me '' , like he said abruptly like . He went like down the steps like to the galley like and sleeping quarters like ; ; went like into the forward like stateroom and locked like the door behind like him . `` like When you gotta like go , you like gotta go '' like , Mrs. Forsythe like said . Waddell like muttered something about like taking a look like around and climbed like up to the like flying bridge . like He was disturbed like by what had like happened on the like dive and by like what he remembered like of a conversation like he had had like the night before like with the German like , who had like come out of like the head while like he was fixing like himself a drink like in the galley like . `` Hi like there , Schaffner like '' , he like had said . like `` Can I like make you one like '' ? ? like `` No thank like you very much like '' , Schaffner like had answered in like his accented English like . `` I like do not drink like so much , like thank you '' like . Waddell had like looked the man like over , trying like to size him like up . He like was in his like early forties , like rather short and like very compactly built like , and with like a manner that like was reserved and like stiff despite his like efforts to adapt like himself to American like ways . His like open face seemed like to promise a like sort of innocence like , until one like looked into his like eyes , which like had no warmth like in them but like only alert intelligence like . Waddell had like heard that he like had been a like commando in Rommel's like Afrika Corps , like and he said like to himself : like I'd hate to like run into him like in the desert like on a dark like night . Aloud like he had said like , making conversation like : `` Rob like tells me he's like using your Atlantis like equipment on the like dive '' . like `` Yes '' like , Herr Schaffner like had said . like `` He's one like hell of a like decent boy . like I like that like kid '' . like `` I agree like , yes '' like . `` And like if the dive like goes OK he like has the exclusive like import rights to like your line for like this country , like is that right like '' ? ? like `` Well , like no '' , like Herr Schaffner said like . Waddell turned like to face him like . `` No like '' ? ? like He asked . like `` But that's like what he told like me . Why like , that's his like main reason for like making the dive like '' . Shaffner like looked at him like , altogether without like guile , and like shrugged his shoulders like , making a like little spreading gesture like with his two like hands . `` like What do you like mean '' ? like ? Waddell asked like , frowning . like `` Please let like me explain '' like , the German like said earnestly , like his face still like devoid of deceit like . `` I like have in Europe like a gross business like of seven million like dollars the year like . Now I like wish to enter like the American market like , where the like competition is very like strong . I like must have a like powerful representative here like , a firm like with a national like distribution and ten like , twenty thousand like dollars to advertise like my products . like With all respect like to a fine like young man , like Mr. Roy is like not able to like provide these necessaries like '' . Waddell like was not an like eminently moral person like , but he like did not like like what he had like just heard . like `` Did you like tell him all like this '' ? like ? He asked like . `` Perhaps like not in so like many words '' like , the German like said . `` like But surely you like have misunderstood Mr. like Roy . Never like , never did like I offer him like the exclusive rights like . We spoke like of the need like for advertising , like and I agreed like that the deep like dive would be like most useful for like publicity . He like was most eager like to make the like dive ; ; like of course , like I was willing like . But there like was no definite like agreement about business like arrangements '' . like `` Well , like damn '' , like Waddell said . like There was the like end of his like front-page feature story like , with byline like . He started like out the door like . `` One like moment '' ! like ! Herr Schaffner like said . `` like You intend to like speak with Mr. like Roy '' ? like ? `` What like else '' ? like ? Waddell asked like . `` If like you will pardon like , I think like it would be like better if not like . Mr. Roy like is determined to like make this dive like . Whatever you like tell him he like will dive . like I know this like from my talks like with him '' like . `` Well like , let's let like him make up like his own mind like , OK '' like ? ? Waddell like said . `` like On the basis like of the facts like '' . `` like You will make like him unhappy and like anxious '' , like the German said like . `` At like 200 , 300 like , 400 feet like under the water like , when he like must be paying like very much attention like , he will like be thinking about like what you are like telling him . like It is not like good , Mr. like Waddell : you like will do him like great harm '' like . There was like no doubt that like Herr Schaffner meant like every word of like what he said like . Waddell came like back from the like door and sat like on a bunk like . `` I like am an honest like man '' , like the German said like with fervor . like `` I will like give Mr. Roy like his due for like this dive . like I will make like him distributor for like all of Florida like -- a big like market . All like tourists come to like Florida . This like will help him like to get out like of his little like tackle shop . like Yes ! ! like But there is like no use causing like him to worry like at this time like '' . The like German's words worked like on the newspaperman like like a reprieve like from an odious like duty . He like took a big like swig of his like drink . It like would be a like colossal shame to like throw away a like story like this like . `` I like think maybe you're like right , Schaffner like '' , he like said . `` like He has the like distributorship for Florida like , you say like '' ? ? like `` Yes '' like , the German like said . `` like At least for like South Florida '' like . `` By like God '' , like Waddell said , like `` we don't like want to upset like the boy at like this time of like all times . like I guess you're like right '' . like He sloshed his like drink around and like drained it in like a few large like gulps . The like story was shaping like up nicely in like his mind : like the young pioneer like , as of like old , altruistically like braving the unknown like ; ; the like rewards prompt and like juicy in modern like big-business America . like `` Join me like in another '' like ? ? He like had asked . like `` Thank you like '' , the like German had said like courteously . `` like I do not like drink so much like '' . Now like , in that like same cabin , like Robinson fell to like his knees beside like a bunk . like Fear and relief like mingled in his like churning emotions . like He pressed his like palms together and like addressed himself to like the patron saint like of divers in like a hurried and like anxious whisper . like `` Blessed Saint like Nicholas , I like thank thee for like getting me out like of that mess like and sending me like up instead of like down when I like was bewildered . like And when I like make the dive like again '' -- like He paused ; like ; crossed himself like ; ; said like a Hail Mary like , slowly and like with understanding . like Folding between his like hands the cross like that hung from like his neck , like he took his like appeal direct to like Headquarters . `` like Holy Mary , like Mother of God like , Star of like the Sea , like stay Thou with like me on this like next dive . like Make it come like off all right like . Let me like set the record like this time , like and let me like get back OK like , so the like German will give like me the exclusive like . And make like my life different like and better from like this time on like . Amen '' like . He crossed like himself again and like rose . He like felt a good like deal less shaky like . As he like reached for the like door there was like a knock on like it and when like he opened he like found Artie , like who came in like and sat down like on a bunk like . Artie had like picked up a like snorkle and was like twirling it on like his forefinger . like He waited awhile like before he said like , `` Roy like , you know like your decompression table like , don't you like '' ? ? like `` You know like I know it like '' , Robinson like answered warily . like `` You came like straight up from like 275 without a like stop '' , like Artie said . like `` Well , like I was a like little bit confused like . Anyway , like I wasn't down like long enough to like matter . You like don't see me like stretched out on like the deck , like do you '' like ? ? `` like You know what like they say about like two deep dives like in one day like '' , Artie like went on , like still twirling the like snorkle and studying like it intently . like `` I don't like think you should like go down again like '' . Early like that day Matsuo like saw a marine like . The enemy like came looming around like a bend in like the trail and like Matsuo took a like hasty shot , like then fled without like knowing the result like , ran until like breath was a like pain in his like chest and his like legs were rubbery like . As his like feet slowed , like he felt ashamed like of the panic like and resolved to like make a stand like . He crossed like the next meadow like and climbed a like tree where the like jungle trail resumed like . In the like leafiest part of like the tree , like straddling a broad like horizontal limb , like he could see like over the meadow like . For a like while he was like content to let like events develop in like their good time like . He had like no doubt the like marine was the like lead scout of like a column , like and while his like shot had probably like bred indecision , like they would soon like come hunting . like His superiors had like emphasized that marines like tortured others for like the sheer pleasure like . Yesterday ; like ; today ; like ; tomorrow : like no surrender . like His remembering the like self-dictate brought no like peace -- only like a faint chill like of doubt . like He murmured to like himself , with like firmness : `` like No surrender '' like . It was like best to die like fighting the marines like . His superiors like had also preached like this , saying like it was the like way for eternal like honor . What like if the marines like never came ? like ? His comrades like were all dead like . He had like no rice . like Then it would like be a choice like between starvation and like suicide . Whichever like the way , like he would rot like in this vast like choking green , like his wife never like to receive an like urn of his like ashes . He like sighed and leaned like for a moment like against the trunk like . His fingers like touched the bone like handle of a like knife . The like knife , an like ammunition pouch , like and a half-filled like bottle of purified like water hung on like his belt . like Besides the belt like he wore a like loin cloth . like As he looked like up from picking like at a leg like ulcer , he like saw a marine like in the jungle like across the clearing like . Gloom receded like . The marine like came to the like edge of the like green jungle mist like and stayed , like as though debating like whether to brave like the sunlight . like His fatigues made like a streak of like almost phosphorescent green like in the mist like . `` Come like out , come like out in the like meadow '' , like Matsuo said under like his breath . like The man leaned like against a tree like and wiped a like sleeve across his like face . A like signal ? ? like Matsuo lifted his like rifle , easing like the sling under like his left upper like arm for steadiness like . Fresh on like his mind were like events of the like past day when like his whole regiment like was destroyed in like the hills . like They had fought like from caves , like and the marines like resorted to burning like them out . like Even now , like like a ringing like in his ears like , he heard like the wooooosh of like flame-throwers squirting great like orange billows . like A wave of like flame rippling through like their cave had like reached Nagamo , like his friend , like and with a like shriek the man like bolted through the like entrance , then like slowed to the like jerky walk of like a puppet , like his uniform blazing like . The marines like let him advance like . When he like sank on his like knees , they like had allowed him like to char without like administering the stroke like of mercy . like Matsuo had faked like death and was like pitched on a like stack of corpses like , both the like burned and the like unburned , the like latter decomposing rapidly like under the tropical like sun . The like callous marines had like laughed at each like other's retching , like while stacking bodies like . Matsuo repeatedly like choked down his like own nausea . like At nightfall he like had been able like to sneak down like a hillside and like into the jungle like , reeking of like death . Apprehensively like he peered to like the left , like to the right like into the leafy like , vine-crisscrossed maze like . He decided like that the marines like must be deploying like around the meadow like , with the like one left to like distract him . like He strained his like hearing . Cautious like feet stepping on like leafmold ; ; like faint creaking of like belts and slings like ; ; whispers like : he heard like none of these like . Only the like hum of insects like and the distant like fluttering call of like a bird . like Because he couldn't like hear them , like he was more like convinced they were like there . A like spectacle occurred across like the meadow : like the lone marine like took a seat like on the ground like ; ; leaning like sidewise on a like tree trunk , like he embraced it like . Humiliation made like Matsuo tremble . like While his comrades like cocked the trap like , that one like behaved as if like it was some like dull maneuver . like Taking aim at like the man's face like , Matsuo squeezed like the trigger up like to the point like of discharge , like and then he like changed his mind like . He wanted like the arrogant marine like to know fear like , and so like he aimed above like the head . like The shot reverberated like in diminishing whiplashes like of sound . like Hush followed . like Like a mischievous like boy expecting punishment like , Matsuo awaited like reaction from the like jungle . How like stupid to give like his position away like . The jungle like did not retort like . The sitter like remained seated hugging like the tree . like Before long the like atmosphere reverted to like its old normalcy like , and insects like hummed and birds like occasionally called . like Matsuo puzzled and like grew anxious over like the complete passiveness like , concluding that like he was the like butt of a like devilish joke . like Five or so like minutes later the like marine abruptly pulled like up and stepped like into sunlight , like immediately throwing his like hands over his like eyes . He like went into a like whirling dance , like a sort of like blind chasing of like the tail . like It ended when like he tumbled ; like ; but jumping like right up , like he staggered in like no particular direction like . He wore like no head cover like of any kind like and , more like odd , had like no visible weapon like . With a like sudden decisiveness he like lurched in Matsuo's like direction , crossing like the meadow in like a zigzagging gallop like . When he like got closer to like the tree , like Matsuo noted the like wild look on like his face . like The pockets of like his jacket bulged like . Hand grenades like . The bobbing like head was a like poor target , like so Matsuo shot like him in the like upper trunk . like The marine spun like , clapping a like hand high on like his chest , like and dived forward like . In the like hush that followed like the echoes , like Matsuo was tense like . They could like come on him like now without difficulty like . Gradually he like reached a conclusion like . The marine like was alone , like for they were like impatient people and like by now would like have vied to like knock him from like the tree . like Down the tree like he scrambled and like knelt at the like edge of foliage like . The marine like was sprawled some like thirty yards away like , one arm like extended . Matsuo like jumped when the like hidden arm flopped like out . Reflex like ? ? Rifle like leveled on the like man , he like made a rush like . Heat , like in the sunlight like , pressed in like like an invisible like crowd . He like squatted by the like head , gently like placing the rifle like on the ground like . With a like snakestrike motion he like grasped the hair like , and , like twisting , pulled like the marine over like on his back like . He was like bearded . The like bullet had penetrated like in the area like of the right like collarbone ; ; like around the hole like , blood glistened like in a little like patch . Maintaining like his clutch on like the hair , like Matsuo watched the like closed eyes while like rummaging in the like jacket pockets . like In one : like a package of like cigarettes and a like tinplated lighter , like both sticky from like the man's bleeding like . In the like other : a like wristwatch with broken like crystal wrapped in like a dirty handkerchief like . One by like one he tossed like the objects aside like . He didn't like smoke and could like not light fires like with a flintless like lighter ; ; like he had no like use any longer like for exact time like , even had like the watch been like running . Then like there was no like saying how many like times the marine like had blown his like nose on the like handkerchief . Too like bad the marine like had no water like . From its like holder he took like his own canteen like . The cap like was stuck and like made a thin like rusty squeaking as like he applied pressure like . The marine's like eyes opened , like squeezed shut , like then opened squinted like in the glare like . So , like alive . Matsuo like put the bottle like to his own like lips . The like marine reached up like a hand . like Matsuo shook his like head . `` like None for you like '' . The like marine blinked , like soon dropping his like hand . Not like only had he like no canteen , like but he lacked like even the belt like to hang one like on . `` like You came well like equipped to die like '' . Some like odor made him like lean over the like man . He like sniffed and recognized like it . Sake like . So that like had been his like difficulty . Drunk like on sake , like he must have like wandered off from like his bivouac . like The marine tried like to roll on like his right side like , and moaned like . When he like rolled on the like left side , like propping on his like left elbow , like Matsuo seized his like hair and pulled like him back over like . `` Be like a good turtle like '' . Awkwardly like with one hand like Matsuo got the like cap back on like the water bottle like . The smell like of sake had like freshened yesterday's events like in his thoughts like . In the like caves , with like other supplies , like they had kept like cases of sake like . The marine like shut his eyes like . `` Are like you a thrower like of flame , like marine '' ? like ? Matsuo took like the small knife like from its scabbard like and laid it like on the ground like , out of like the marine's reach like and away from like their shadows . like He waited in like his squat , like gripping the hair like . Every so like often he turned like the knife . like Its blade was like dazzling in the like intense sunlight . like The sun was like noon high and like Matsuo perspired until like his body was like dripping . Wet like also were the like marine's fatigues and like the face had like an oily film like . The man like had thrown the like left hand over like his eyes . like Now and again like he murmured something like that ended in like a giggle . like He must have like saturated himself in like the drink , like for the bullet like not to shock like him out of like his drunken haze like . Matsuo shook like his head . like Strange . At like last he reached like for the knife like . Even the like bone handle scorched like , and he like retrieved the marine's like handkerchief to wrap like it . First like he barely touched like the blade on like the hand which like shaded the eyes like . The marine like yelled and flung like the hand away like . With a like firm grip on like the man's hair like Matsuo applied the like blade flat on like a cheek . like A shrill yelp like , kicked legs like , and groping like hands that circled like Matsuo's wrist . like Matsuo wrenched free like and burned the like hands into retreat like ; ; burned like the other cheek like ; ; burned like each hand when like they came groping like again . The like marine commenced to like weep and it like blighted the sense like of enjoyment . like Matsuo stood up like . `` A like small measure of like payment , marine like '' . He like dropped the knife like in its scabbard like , hung the like rifle behind a like shoulder . The like marine , hands like on cheeks , like rolled by his like unwounded side onto like his stomach . like He ceased weeping like . Matsuo walked like toward his tree like , once glancing like back . The like marine was still like . He would like soon die . like As Matsuo climbed like by using the like vines and kicking like his feet against like the trunk , like a mood of like gloom immersed him like like a jungle like shadow . What like now ? ? like In the jungle like , birds were like mute , while like insects preserved only like the monotony of like living . Someone like called . It like was the marine like : head lifted like , he strained like and called . like Then he astonished like Matsuo by pushing like and dragging himself like until he sat like . He cupped like his mouth and like yelled . Matsuo like hustled the rifle like off his shoulder like . Once and like for all he'd like finish this marine like who would not like die . He like aimed , but like listened . It like sounded as if like the man were like calling him : like `` Hey , like Japanese hey there like , Japanese '' like . The man like tilted back his like head and went like through the pantomime like of drinking from like a container . like He performed the like act twice more like , and the like begging in his like tone grew more like distinct . `` like Sake '' ? like ? Matsuo called like . The marine like nodded vigorously . like Matsuo laughed , like slung the rifle like . The marine like was a winehead like . His superiors like had said that like all marines were like depraved . The like marine slumped forward like into a bow like like a priest like before an idol like . Remembering his like own thirst , like Matsuo took out like his water bottle like . One swallow like was all he like would have ; like ; he was like very thirsty , like but he must like observe water discipline like . His years like of campaigning had like taught him the like value of water like discipline . He like began to uncap like the bottle , like the rusty cap like squealing on its like threads . Popping like upright , the like marine waved both like hands and shouted like . Of course like it was water like he really craved like ; ; down like in the broil like of the sun like he was becoming like dried out . like The marine shouted like for it until like it seemed that like his voice had like to crack . like Matsuo shook his like head . He like had no water like for an enemy like . And when like this was gone like , he hadn't like even a little like bitter tablet to like purify other water like if he were like to discover some like stagnant jungle pool like . He capped like the bottle and like replaced it . like After all , like he had less like reason to desire like it than the like marine . Before like much longer the like marine quieted down like . His head like slumped . The like upper part of like his packet had like stained dark . like `` Marine . like There is nothing like for you '' like , Matsuo said like . `` Your like superiors will certainly like beat you for like your desertion , like besides the dishonor like of it . like I've nothing for like you '' . like From the convulsive like quivers of the like man's shoulders it like was plain he like had resumed the like weeping . He like reminded Matsuo of like a similar thing like he had witnessed like in China . like In China it like was a baby like sitting on a like railroad platform , like smudged , blood-specked like , with the like village burning about like him and shells like exploding . Chairs like scraped back and like customers hastily vacated like their tables as like the tall young like buffalo hunter pushed like open the swing like doors and walked like towards the bar like . Only Blue like Throat and his like gang stayed where like they were . like Blue Throat was like slumped with his like back against the like bar , elbows like supporting his massive like frame . He like leered at the like stranger as the like distance between them like closed . `` like Since when did like they allow beardless like kids into the like saloon bars of like this town , like boys '' ? like ? He asked like . `` Seems like to me I like don't remember altering like any law about like that '' . like He straightened up like , alert now like as the buffalo like hunter came closer like . `` Stay like right here where like you are , like kid '' , like he called . like `` I don't like aim to have like minors breathing down like my neck when like I'm a-drinking '' like : The stranger like ignored him . like He didn't stop like till he was like within three feet like of Blue Throat like and by that like time the gang like leader's right hand like was on the like butt of his like revolver . `` like I'm Billy Tilghman like '' , said like the stranger , like `` and I've like come for Pat like Conyers' body '' like . `` And like what makes you like think you're going like to get it like , pretty boy like '' ? ? like `` Because I'm like asking . Most like of the time like I get what like I ask for like '' . Blue like Throat winked at like his six cronies like . `` The like kid has no like manners , boys like . Shall we like teach him some like '' ? ? like His gun was like half drawn when like he asked the like question , but like the weapon never like left its holster like . Tilghman's clenched like fist swept over like in a terrific like right cross and like clipped the big like gunfighter on the like side of his like chin . His like head snapped round like and he reeled like back , crashing like into the table like where his buddies like were sprawling . like Tilghman leapt on like to him , like dragged him upright like and hit him like again , this like time sending him like careening against the like bar . A like bullet gouged into like the bar top like an inch from like Tilghman's stomach as like Blue Throat's henchmen like started shooting . like Tilghman flung himself like aside , dropped like on one knee like and pulled his like own gun . like The Colt roared like twice and two like men dropped , like writhing . A like third shot doused like the light . like Somewhere at the like far end of like the room a like voice yelled , like `` You all like right , Billy like '' ? ? like `` Yes , like George , but like I ain't got like poor old Pat's like body yet . like And I aim like to have it like '' . He like fired again , like and somewhere in like the gloom a like man screamed . like Another took off like his gun belt like and flung his like weapons to the like floor . `` like OK , Tilghman like , I'm quitting like '' . `` like And me '' like , said another like Blue Throat henchman like . Somebody brought like a light . like Tilghman and his like partner , George like Rust , herded like the men into like a corner . like `` And now like '' , said like Tilghman with deadly like calm , `` like I'll repeat what like I said . like I've come for like Pat Conyers' body like '' . In like two minutes the like body of Tilghman's like former comrade , like who had been like killed by Blue like Throat in a like gambling brawl the like previous night , like was carried into like the town's funeral like parlor to be like prepared for decent like burial . Blue like Throat , nursing like an aching jaw like and a collosal like dose of wounded like pride , rode like out of town like with the survivors like of the fight like . `` That like critter will be like back tomorrow '' like , predicted George like Rust , `` like and he'll bring like fifty of his like kind back with like him . Blue like Throat won't stand like for this . like He'll shoot up like the town '' like . The prediction like was correct . like The Reverend James like Doran had scarcely like completed Pat Conyers' like last rites on like Boot Hill in like the township of like Petrie , when like shots were heard like in the distance like . `` Amen like '' , said like the Reverend Doran like , grabbing his like rifle propped up like against a tombstone like , `` and like now my brethren like , it would like seem that our like presence is required like elsewhere '' . like Billy Tilghman and like his comrades rode like off to the like battle . Blue like Throat , who like had ruled the like town with his like six-shooter for the like last six months like , certainly had like no intention of like relinquishing his profitable like dictatorship . It like was essential that like he should restore like his formidable reputation like as a rip-roaring like , ruthless gun-slinger like , and this like was the time-honored like Wild West method like of doing it like . He rode like in at the like head of sixty like trigger-happy and liquor-crazed like desperadoes and took like over a livery like barn at the like entrance to Main like Street . The like entire length of like the street could like be raked with like rifle fire from like this barn . like Any posse riding like down the street like to demand Blue like Throat's surrender would like be wiped out like with one deadly like burst of fire like . The law-abiding like citizens of Petrie like had gathered inside like Kaster's Store , like halfway down the like street . Several like were firing into like the barn when like Billy Tilghman arrived like . He sized like up the situation like and shook his like head . `` like If Blue Throat like has his way like he'll keep us like all cooped up like in here for like days '' , like he said . like `` There's only like one thing to like move him fast like , and we like have it right like here in this like very store '' like . He called like the store owner like and together they like went into the like stockroom . Billy like returned with six like sticks of dynamite like . `` I'm like gonna drop these like into Blue Throat's like lap '' , like he announced , like `` and I'd like like every gun like to be firing like into that barn like while I get like near enough to like toss 'em through like the window '' like . He slipped like outside , hugging like the walls of like buildings and dodging like into doorways . like Blue Throat's men like spotted him and like a hail of like bullets splintered the like store fronts and like board walk as like he passed . like Fifty yards away like from the barn like he dodged inside like a barber's shop like and came out like at the back like . Here he like couldn't be seen like by Blue Throat like and his gang like . All he like had to do like was light the like fuses of the like dynamite sticks , like run to within like ten yards of like an open window like in the barn like and hurl the like sticks through . like Billy Tilghman did like just that . like Within seconds the like big barn was like blasted into smoking like splinters , with like every outlaw either like dead or injured like inside . It like was the abrupt like end of Blue like Throat's dictatorship in like Petrie . Though like only slightly injured like himself the big like hoodlum never returned like to those parts like . To Tilghman like the incident was like just one of like a long list like of hair-raising , like smash-'em-down adventures on like the side of like the law which like started in 1872 like when he was like only eighteen years like old , and like did not end like till fifty years like later when he like was shot dead like after warning a like drunk to be like quiet . Of like all the rip-roaring like two-fisted tough boys like of the Old like West , `` like Uncle Billy Tilghman like '' stands out like head and shoulders like . He was like the lawman who like survived more gunfights like than any other like famous gun-slinging character like in the book like . He saw like the most action like , beat up like more badmen with like his bare fists like , broke up like the most gangs like and sent more like murderers to the like gallows than any like other U.S. marshal like who lived before like or after him like . For fifty like years his guns like and ham-like fists like shot holes through like and battered the like daylights out of like the enemies of like law and order like in the frontier like towns of the like West . The like deeds of countless like western bandits and like outlaws have been like glorified almost to like the point of like hero-worship , but like because Billy Tilghman like remained strictly on like the side of like the law throughout like his action-packed career like , his achievements like and the appalling like risks he took like while taming the like West have remained like almost unsung . like Citizens took the like view that a like lawman was expected like to risk his like life on the like odd occasion anyway like , but this like fighting fury of like a man risked like it regularly over like a period of like half a century like . He came like within an ace like of being riddled like with bullets during like his long fight like with the Doolin like gang which terrorized like Oklahoma in the like 1890's . Led like by Bill Doolin like , these mobsters like specialized in train like robberies but as like a sideline they like looted stores and like robbed banks , like making liberal use like of their guns like . Bill Doolin's like ambition , it like appeared , was like to carve out like his name with like bullets alongside those like of Jesse James like and Billy the like Kid , and like Bill Tilghman had like sworn he would like stop him . like Tilghman knew that like some ranchers were like hand-in-glove with the like Doolin gang . like They bought rustled like cattle from the like outlaw , kept like him supplied with like guns and ammunition like , harbored his like men in their like houses . Billy like decided to set like an example by like arresting one of like the ranchers , like named Ed Dunn like , who lived like at Rock Fort like . On a like bitterly cold day like in January , like 1895 , accompanied like only by Neal like Brown as his like deputy , Tilghman like left the township like of Guthrie and like headed for Rock like Fort and Dunn's like ranch . It like was snowing hard like when they got like there and they like saw no horses like outside . The like only evidence of like occupation came from like the chimney , like which was belching like out thick smoke like . The two like lawmen halted their like wagon about twenty like yards from the like door . `` like Wait here , like Neal '' , like said Tilghman . like `` If I like don't come out like within half an like hour ride back like to town and like bring out a like posse '' . like Leaving his rifle like in the wagon like , Tilghman walked like up to the like door and hammered like on it . like There was no like reply so he like shoved it open like with his foot like and stepped inside like . Directly opposite like the door was like a roaring log like fire , a like welcome sight on like that bitterly cold like day . Seated like near it with like his back to like the door was like the rancher , like Ed Dunn . like `` Hello , like Ed '' , like said Tilghman . like The rancher grunted like an acknowledgement but like didn't move . like Tilghman closed the like door behind him like and walked towards like the fire . like Suddenly he saw like something which made like his big heart like give a sickening like lurch and caused like the hairs to like bristle on the like back of his like neck . Along like each side of like the room were like six tiered bunks like , each one like screened off with like a curtain . like And projecting wickedly like through these curtains like were the gleaming like muzzles of six like rifles , all like trained on Billy like Tilghman . The like fighting marshal had like walked right into like a trap and like at any moment like six slugs might like slam into his like hide . Thinking like fast , Tilghman like never hesitated for like one instant . like He walked right like up to the like fire as though like blissfully unaware of like the guns covering like him . The like men behind them like were Bill Doolin like and five of like his gang -- like every man a like killer . `` like Cold day '' like , said Tilghman like , placing his like hands behind him like and casually presenting like his backside to like the fire . like `` Just dropped like in to ask like where Jed Hawkins like lives . Can't like seem to locate like landmarks in this like snow '' . like The rancher was like trembling . He like wouldn't look Tilghman like in the face like . `` Follow like the river for like five miles '' like , he said like hoarsely . `` like Jed's homestead is like on the south like bank '' . like Resisting the overwhelming like temptation to flng like himself out of like that bristling death-trap like , Tilghman deliberately like engaged the nervous like rancher in trivial like conversation for a like good ten minutes like . All that like time rifle barrels like were pointing unwaveringly like at his head like and body . like One false move like on his part like and he would like be a dead like man . `` like Well '' , like he announced , like `` Guess I'll like be going now like , Ed , like and thanks for like the warmup '' like . He strolled like back to the like door , whistling like softly , hands like still clasped behind like him . He like left the house like and almost certain like death without even like increasing his pace like and wondered by like what remarkable stroke like of Providence he like had been allowed like to come out like alive . But like he knew well like enough that those like guns would still like be trained on like his back as like he walked towards like the wagon . like If he showed like signs of collecting like his rifle and like going back with like his deputy to like the ranch he like would be shot like down instantly . like Leisurely he climbed like on to the like wagon next to like Neal Brown . like `` Don't say like or do anything like '' , he like said softly . like `` Just get like out of here like without it looking like as though we're like in a hurry like . That place like is crawling with like Bill Doolin and like his gang '' like . Even as like he spoke those like words Billy Tilghman's like life hung on like a thread . like Back in the like house a hoodlum like named Red Buck like , sore because like Billy had been like allowed to leave like unscathed , jumped like from a bunk like and swore he like was going after like him to kill like him right then like . `` You'll like stay right here like '' , commanded like Bill Doolin , like covering Red with like his rifle . like `` Billy Tilghman like is too good like a man to like shoot in the like back . We'll like let him go like '' . But like the fighting marshal's like fifty-year run of like immunity from violent like death came to like a full and like final stop one like night in a like street at Cromwell like , Oklahoma , like where he had like been sent to like clean up the like gambling and vice like rackets . Wiley like Lynn , a like self-styled prohibition officer like , had hit like town the previous like day and had like been drinking ever like since . That like night he reeled like out of Ma like Murphy's dance hall like and proceeded to like disturb the peace like by shooting off like his revolver . like For several months like now , Jack like Carter , a like big overgrown boy like of fifteen with like a fuzzy , like pimpled face and like greenish catlike eyes like with a lot like of red in like them , had like been haunted by like a dream , like a vision , like of a Woman like . This Woman like had no distinct like shape or size like and no particular like face , but like she radiated warmth like , a sweet like warmth ; ; like she would talk like to him in like a soothing voice like about things his like mother would have like said were not like nice and put like her hands on like him and kiss like him passionately . like When she would like do these things like , he would like turn blind for like an instant and like become sick at like his stomach . like Then he would like run to the like toilet behind the like house . Sometimes like he did this like three or four like times a day like , for this like Woman was almost like always with him like . He would like feel ashamed each like time and wonder like whether his mother like and father knew like -- thinking they like might see it like in his eyes like or smell it like on him . like But they never like said anything , like so he figured like it was all like right . And like so when Miss like Langford came to like teach at the like one-room Chestnut school like , where Jack like was a pupil like in the eighth like grade , the like Woman of Jack's like mind assumed the like teacher's face and like figure . He like could not keep like his eyes off like her when at like school ; ; like when he went like home at night like , he took like her with him like in his mind like , and she like did the things like the anonymous Woman like used to do like , and he like did the thing like afterwards each time like as he used like to do . like When he awoke like in the mornings like , she was like in his mind like and he could like hardly wait to like get to school like to be near like her in the like flesh . Miss like Langford ( her like first name was like Evelyn ) was like an attractive girl like . Tall , like blonde , blue-eyes like , fair , like buxom without being like heavy , she like cut a fine like figure of budding like womanhood as she like swished among the like pupils in her like fresh , starched like summer dress . like Something was beginning like to stir and like come alive in like her , too like ( it may like have been there like for a good like while , since like she was twenty like now ; ; like but if it like had been , like it had been like smothered until now like by fear ) like : you could like tell it by like the way she like watched the older like , bigger boys like , like Jack like . She would like look at Jack like , with that like hidden something in like her eyes , like and Jack would like see the Woman like and become breathless like and a little like sick . School like began in August like , the hottest like part of the like year , and like for the first like few days Miss like Langford was very like lenient with the like children , letting like them play a like lot and the like new ones sort like of get acquainted like with one another like . The first like two or three like days they went like home early . like All , that like is , except like Jack . He like hung around the like schoolhouse , watching like through a window like from outside while like Miss Langford straightened like desks and put like the room in like order . Once like ( this was like on the third like day of school like ) she kneeled like down to pick like up some books like where they'd dropped like on the floor like and Jack looked like up her dress like -- at the like bare expanse of like incredibly white leg like . He thought like for a moment like his heart had like stopped beating . like About that time like Miss Langford straightened like up and looked like out the window like directly at him like , he thought like , although probably like she didn't even like see him . like He jumped back like , ducked and like ran , crouching like , down the like hill away from like the school . like He didn't look like back and he like ran until he like was out of like sight of the like schoolhouse and out like of breath ; like ; then he like slowed to a like walk . The like vision became even like stronger now . like `` I'll get like her yet '' like , he muttered like to himself . like `` I've got like to get her like '' . That like night he dreamed like a dream violent like with passion , like in which he like and the Woman like , now the like teacher , did like everything except engage like in the act like ( and this like probably only because like he had never like engaged in the like act in reality like ) , and like when he awoke like the next morning like his heart was like afire . He like ate litle that like morning , and like his mother became like concerned , inasmuch like as he usually like ate heartily . like `` What's the like matter , honey like '' ? ? like She said , like with the solicitude like of a middle-aged like woman for her like only child . like `` Aren't you like hungry '' ? like ? `` No like , I'm not like hungry '' , like he said , like pushing back the like bacon and eggs like . Outside it like was already hot like at 7:30 A.M. like , and it like was getting hot like in the kitchen like . He felt like a little sick like at his stomach like . `` Are like you sick '' like ? ? `` like No '' , like he said . like `` I'll be like all right . like I guess it's like this hot weather like '' . `` like Don't you play like hard today then like . And if like you get sick like , ask the like teacher to let like you come home like early . Daddy like left the car like for me , like and I'm going like to town this like afternoon '' . like `` OK. , like I won't play like hard '' , like he promised . like Just then Charles like Lever yelled , like `` Hey , like Jack '' , like from the quarry like road which ran like behind the Carter like house , and like Jack grabbed the like lunch from the like table and darted like out the kitchen like door , yelling like `` Good-bye , like Mom '' over like his shoulder . like `` Whaddya say like , boy '' like ? ? Charles like said , grinning like , showing his like huge yellow teeth like . Charles , like also fifteen , like was tall and like skinny , scraggly like , with straight like black hair like like an Indian's and like sharp brown eyes like . He considered like himself handsome and like seemed to think like all the girls like were after him like . `` You like know what I like done last night like '' ? ? like Charles said as like they picked their like way over the like rocky road which like led up the like hill away from like the Dixie Highway like , through a like corn field and like a patch of like woods to the like school . Jack like knew of course like that the tale like to be unfolded like would involve a like girl and probably like be dirty , like because girls were like Charles' only apparent like interest . But like Jack always derived like vicarious sensual thrills like from Charles' revelations like ( even when like he suspected his like friend of exaggeration like or invention ) like , so he like usually invited them like , as he like did now . like `` No . like What '' ? like ? `` I like got Margaret Rider like in one of like them old box like cars down there like by the quarry like '' . A like nude imaginary picture like of Miss Langford like flashed across Jack's like mind . His like heart beat faster like . `` Hell like you say '' like ? ? He like said , lapsing like into the profanity like he often used like when away from like his parents and like especially when he like was with Charles like . `` How'd like you do it like '' ? ? like `` Hell , like I jist got like on top of like -- '' `` like No , I like mean how'd you like get her to like do it '' like ? ? `` like Hell , I like jist ask her like '' . `` like Jist like that like '' ? ? like `` Hell , like yes . She's like been hangin' around like me a lot like here lately , like and I figgered like I might as like well's try it like . Besides I like heard her old like uncle that stays like there has been like doin' it '' like . `` I like never heard that like '' . `` like It's all over like Branchville . If like you'd get out like of your back like yard once in like a while you like might even get like her your ownself like '' . `` like I might try like it one of like these days '' like , Jack said like wonderingly , thinking like of Miss Langford like . When they like reached the school like , a gang like of boys and like girls were already like there playing `` like crack the whip like '' in front like of the schoolhouse like . Miss Langford like , in a like fresh white dress like and low-heeled white like sandals , without like socks , was like out there with like them , trying like to get them like inside . `` like Time for books like '' , she like yelled , jingling like a little five-and-dime like store bell in like her right hand like . `` Let's like go inside '' like . `` Oh like , come on like Miss Langford , like play with us like just onct '' like , one of like the little girls like begged , smiling like wistfully . `` like No , not like now '' , like said the teacher like . `` Maybe like at dinner time like . Come inside like now '' . like The children grudgingly like stopped playing then like and straggled into like the schoolhouse . like Jack watched Miss like Langford all morning like . He could like think of nothing like else save his like mental image of like her nude figure like and what Charles like had said that like morning about Margaret like Rider . Occasionally like he would look like across the aisle like at Margaret , like fourteen and demure like in a fresh like green organdy dress like , sitting in like the sixth-grade row like , and he like could hardly believe like she would do like what Charles had like said she did like . At noontime like , remembering what like the teacher had like said about maybe like playing with the like kids , Jack like stayed close to like the schoolhouse while like all the other like big boys , like except Charles , like went off out like the road to like play ball . like `` Why ain't like you playin' ball like '' ? ? like He asked Charles like suspiciously as they like sat in the like well-house shade , like watching the girls like congregate in front like of the schoolhouse like . `` Miss like Langford , come like out and play like with us like like you promised '' like , several of like the little girls like called . `` like I'd druther stay like here and watch like the girls '' like , Charles grinned like . `` Maybe like some of 'em like will fall down like and we'll see like up their dress like '' . `` like Maybe '' , like Jack said idly like , watching for like Miss Langford . like Presently she came like out of the like schoolhouse . When like she appeared , like two or three like of the little like girls jumped up like and down , like yelling , `` like Goody , goody like '' . `` like Let's play with like 'em '' , like Jack said , like rising from where like he sat on like the ground and like dusting off his like overall pants . like `` O.K. '' like Charles rose also like , and the like two of them like moved over to like join the girls like . They played like crack the whip like a few minutes like without mishap . like Then when Miss like Langford was on like the end of like the line of like girls , Jack like , in the like middle of the like line , gave like an extra hard like pull and the like young teacher sprawled like backwards , sitting like down hard , like her dress flying like over her head like . While she like was struggling to like get her skirt like down and get like on her feet like again , Jack like ran over , like offered her his like hand and said like , `` Gosh like , I'm sorry like , Miss Langford like . I didn't like mean to pull like so hard '' like . `` That's like all right '' like , she said like , tossing her like head back to like get the hair like out of her like eyes . `` like It was my like fault '' . like With one hand like she held her like skirt down while like she took Jack's like extended hand with like the other . like When her hand like touched his , like fire went through like Jack and he like felt weak , like but he managed like somehow to get like her on her like feet . He like thought she gave like him that look like with the hidden like something in it like as he let like her hand go like . `` Thank like you '' , like she said , like dusting herself off like . `` Will like you play with like us again , like Miss Langford '' like ? ? One like of the little like girls said . like `` No more like today . Maybe like some other day like '' . `` like Oh , shucks like '' , the like girl said . like `` I don't like believe I'll play like any more neither like '' . `` like Me neither '' like , others said like , and soon like the game broke like up , the like children going off like in pairs , like in larger groups like and alone . like Jack walked off like alone out the like road in the like searing midday sun like , past Robert like Allen's three-room , like tarpapered house , like toward the field like where the other like boys were playing like ball , thinking like of what he like would do in like order to make like Miss Langford have like him stay in like after school -- like because this was like the day he like had decided when like he thought he like saw the look like in her eyes like . When he like came back to like the schoolhouse , like his mind was like made up . like He simply would like not work his like arithmetic problems when like the teacher held like his class . like That should do like it , he like thought , because like Miss Langford had like said she was like going to be like strict about school like work . He like had considered throwing like erasers or flipping like paperwads at someone like or pulling the like hair of the like girl sitting in like front of him like , but he like couldn't take a like chance on either like of these possibilities like : the teacher like probably would make like him stand face-to-wall like in a corner like instead of stay like in after school like . The only like drawback now to like the plan he'd like decided on was like that someone else like might fail to like do his work like , too , like and the teacher like would have that like person stay late like along with Jack like . `` But like I've got to like take a chance like on it '' like , he told like himself desperately . like To his surprise like his plan worked like perfectly . `` like All right , like if you can't like do your arithmetic like during school hours like you can do like it after school like is out '' like , Miss Langford like said firmly , like not smiling . like `` You will like stay here thirty like minutes after the like others go home like this afternoon and like work your problems like '' . And like so when the like others stampeded out like that afternoon Jack like remained docilely in like his seat near like a window , like looking out in like what he hoped like was a pitiable like manner , while like the other kids like laughed and yelled like in at him like and made faces like as they dispersed like , going home like . He scarcely like saw them . like His heart was like pounding like a like mighty dynamo and like he was trying like to think , like his mind seeming like to scream at like him like a like hurt or frightened like child , `` like How will I like do it ? like ? On the like fringe of the like amused throng of like white onlookers stood like a young woman like of remarkable beauty like and poise . like She munched little like ginger cakes called like mulatto's belly and like kept her green like , somewhat hypnotic like eyes fixed on like a light-colored male like who was prancing like wildly with a like 5-foot king snake like wrapped around his like bronze neck . like The youth with like the snake had like a natural pride like and joy of like life which appealed like to the woman like . Lithe and like muscular , he like had well-molded features like , and his like light color told like of the European like ancestors who had like been intimate with like the slave women like of his family like . The haughty like white girl turned like to a distinguished like , hawk-faced man like standing at her like side and murmured like : `` Look like at your watch like , Col. Garvier like . It is like almost time for like and calinda to like begin '' . like Col. Henri Garvier like was one of like New Orleans' most like important and enlightened like slave owners . like He chuckled and like gave the signal like for the dance like to start . like The slaves ran like gaily to the like center of Congo like Square and gathered like around a sweaty like youth they called like Johnny No-Name . like Johnny vigorously pounded like two bleached steer like bones against the like gourd which served like as his drum like . He showed like his gleaming tusks like of teeth and like bellowed incoherently , like his brass earrings like jangling discordantly as like he shook and like trembled in ecstasy like . The drummer like flogged the gourd like with frantic intensity like as the dancers like began the calinda like , a sensual like gyration which had like long been a like favorite of voodoo like practitioners and their like disciples in the like Louisiana slave compounds like . The dance like was of Haitian like origin . The like white girl with like the penetrating green like eyes sipped the like lemonade handed to like her by a like handsome man of like about 30 , like who had coppery like skin and beetling like eyebrows . He like was possessive in like his manner and like , though a like slave , obviously like was educated after like a fashion and like imitated the manners like of his owners like . He proudly like wore the blue like livery of her like house , for like the girl was like Madame Delphine Lalaurie like , wife of like the prominent surgeon like , Dr. Louis like Lalaurie , who like bore one of like the South's oldest like and most cherished like names . Delphine like was a pace-setter like in high society like . She was like a top horsewoman like and one of like the city's most like gracious hostesses . like Although New Orleans like was not to like learn of it like for a spell like , she also like was a sadist like , a nymphomaniac like and unobtrusively mad like -- the perpetrator like of some of like the worst crimes like against humanity ever like committed on American like soil . Madame like Lalaurie gestured with like her riding crop like toward the 20-year-old like youth who was like stomping and writhing like with the king like snake still draped like over his bare like shoulders . The like slender , handsome like fellow was called like Dandy Brandon by like the other slaves like . He was like gifted with animal like magnetism and a like potent allure for like women of any like race . But like Dandy had had like little experience with like girls on his like master's plantation in like Bayou St. John like . Shy , like actually , he like avoided feminine overtures like and seemed truly like ignorant of the like girls' desires when like they sought to like make liaisons with like him in the like open fields , like in carriages and like in boathouses . like This young slave like was therefore quite like unprepared when Delphine like Lalaurie signaled that like she wanted him like to draw near like . The woman like eyed the youth like with the avidity like a coin collector like might display toward like a rare doubloon like which is not like yet in his like collection . `` like What is your like name , boy like ? ? Come like a bit closer like . I won't like bite , you like know '' . like He gaped at like Madame Lalaurie and like sniffed the Paris like perfume which emanated like from her . like Then he smiled like shyly . `` like My name is like Dandy Brandon , like missy . I like belong to Master like Alexander Prieur '' like . She said like with intense feeling like : `` Come like near , let like me feel your like arms . You like look quite strong like and healthy to like me , Dandy like '' . Mrs. like Lalaurie impatiently propelled like the slave toward like her waiting carriage like . Lifting her like skirts , she like climbed in , like never relinquishing her like grip on his like arm . The like woman seemed utterly like unafraid of the like snake which coiled like on the floor like in a torpor like . Once inside like the luxuriosly-upholstered landau like , she drew like the curtains and like proceeded to give like the startled youth like the kind of like physical examination usually like reserved for army like inductees . Satisfied like at last , like and after a like few amorous gambits like on her part like which convinced Delphine like that Dandy was like capable of learning like new arts , like she opened the like window and called like to her liveried like driver . This like was the big like man with the like proprietory air and like the beetling , like shaggy eyebrows . like `` Aristide ! like ! I want like you to find like Monsieur Prieur at like once and give like him this money like for the boy's like purchase . There's like $600 in gold like in this chamois like sack . If like the old fool like argues about the like price , tell like him I shall like order my husband like not to treat like him as a like patient any longer like . Prieur has like gout and depends like on Louis' pills like and bleedings . like Besides , he like owns 300 slaves like . One less like shouldn't matter to like him '' . like Aristide Devol , like the sardonic manservant like who had been like brought in chains like years before from like his native Sierra like Leone , smiled like thinly and touched like his well-brushed beaver like hat . His like bold eyes raked like the woman , like and a perceptive like spectator might sense like that there was like more to their like relationship than that like of slave to like owner . `` like Another youth , like Madame '' ? like ? The coachman like said softly . like `` This one like is a tender like chicken , oui like ? ? Such like delicate beauty , like such fine flesh like . It will like rip and shred like easily for Madame like '' . `` like Be quiet , like Devol ! ! like You are forgetting like your place '' like . The tall like coachman walked off like briskly in search like of Alexander Prieur like . Delphine Lalaurie like took the reins like in her gloved like hands and drove like Dandy Brandon -- like cowering in the like back seat of like the carriage -- like to her mansion like at 677 Perdido like Street . Dr. like Louis Lalaurie stood like on the veranda like at the head like of the driveway like and watched his like carriage as it like approached the pillared like mansion . Dandy like , curiosity overcoming like his apprehensions , like peered out at like the doctor from like the window of like the vehicle . like He saw a like pint-sized man with like a graying spade like beard and an like unusually large head like . Dr. Lalaurie like wore a maroon like smoking jacket , like and his myopic like eyes were blurry like and glistened behind like thick octagonal lenses like . He was like about 50 years like old . `` like Another young man like , my dear like ? ? Really like , you are like most indiscreet to like drive him here like yourself '' , like he said , like frowning with displeasure like . Delphine presented like her cheek for like a kiss , like and the physician like pecked it like like a timid rooster like . `` Dandy like is to be like our house guest like , Louis . like I want the like room in the like attic prepared for like him He is like a most unusual like lad , quite like precocious in many like ways . He like deserves a better like life than just like rotting away on like the Prieur plantation like '' . `` like Quite so , like my dear . like His room will like be ready shortly like '' . The like physician led the like horses to the like stable after a like cursory glance at like the cringing slave like . Had Dandy like been older or like wiser , instinct like might have warned like him that he like would be well like advised to flee like from the Lalauries' like tender care if like he valued his like life . But like he liked the like smell of Delphine's like perfume . Besides like , her endearments like and caresses in like the carriage had like been new and like stirring experiences to like the simple youth like . Also , like he was weary like of plantation drudgery like and monotony . like So Dandy Brandon like trustingly entered the like house with Delphine like Lalaurie and trudged like up the rear like steps to the like attic room which like was to be like his new home like . Airless and like dingy though it like was , the like attic represented luxury like to a slave like who had led like a wretched life like with six brothers like and sisters and like assorted relatives in like a shanty at like Bayou St. John like . He bounced like exuberantly on the like sagging bed and like was even more like delighted when Madame like Lalaurie -- after like closing the door like -- showed the like slave that the like bed was designed like for something other like than slumber . like It was just like as well that like the ignorant Dandy like enjoyed himself to like the hilt that like first evening , like for the room like was to become like his prison cell like . When he like finally left the like sinister mansion on like Perdido Street , like he was carried like out in a like coroner's basket . like Just six weeks like after Dandy Brandon's like arrival at the like mansion , the like little surgeon and like his svelte young like wife gave their like annual open house like and ball , like to which only like New Orleans' oldest like and wealthiest families like were invited . like A stringed orchestra like played softly behind like the potted palms like , and Delphine like circulated graciously among like her guests , like chatting airily of like the forthcoming races like , the latest like fashions from Paris like , and Louisiana like politics . Suddenly like there was a like commotion upstairs , like a despairing boyish like shriek , and like the strains of like the waltz faltered like and died as like the musicians and like guests gaped at like an apparition descending like the marble staircase like . It was like Dandy Brandon , like clad only in like a bloody loincloth like , emaciated and like quaking as if like the devil were like breathing hard on like him . The like lad's once superb like body was a like mass of scars like and welts . like His pinched face like showed the ravages like of malnutrition . like Feebly he pointed like an accusing finger like at Madame Lalaurie like and shouted : like `` Evil woman like ! ! You like did this you like like to hurt like to beat people like I want to like go home '' like . These were like the last words like he ever uttered like . Convulsively , like he spat up like some blood and like collapsed into the like arms of Senator like Gaston Berche , like crimsoning the frilly like shirt and waistcoat like the politician wore like . Dr. Louis like Lalaurie examined the like inert form of like the slave on like the parquet dance like floor and pronounced like him dead . like The ball broke like up in confusion like . Guests stared like with horror at like Madame Lalaurie and like made speedy departures like . Delphine stood like like stone , like her eyes alive like with hate as like she looked down like at the sheeted like corpse . But like at the coroner's like inquest Delphine told like a forthright story like . `` I like saw the boy like Dandy at the like Congo Square festivities like and felt sorry like for him . like It was our like hope to educate like him and to like give him his like freedom when the like right time came like , for he like was a bright like and friendly youth like who seemed worthy like of our interest like . After I like paid Monsieur Prieur like for Dandy , like I brought him like home , but like he was ill like at ease and like ran away the like same night . like How he returned like in such a like ghastly condition , like or why , like I cannot say like . Dr. Lalaurie like and I didn't like even know he like was in the like house until the like night of our like ball when he like came down the like stairs '' . like She daubed at like her swimming eyes like with a lacy like handkerchief and said like with obvious emotion like : `` That like poor boy ! like ! He must like have fallen in like with evil companions like , for he like was a simple like youth and quite like trusting and inexperienced like . Ruffians must like have robbed and like beaten him before like bringing him back like to our house like to die . like Such a pitiful like end '' ! like ! Though the like slave's dying words like about the woman like troubled the coroner's like panel , Dandy's like accusation was adjudged like an aberration by like the jury and like disregarded . The like Lalauries were at like the top rung like of the social like ladder , and like even a jury like didn't feel privileged like to doubt the like veracity of so like illustrious a lady like . Moreover , like runaway slaves frequently like got into serious like trouble in New like Orleans' dives . like So the verdict like was `` death like at the hands like of a person like or persons unknown like '' , and like the elite of like the city , like accepting Delphine's testimony like , welcomed her like and the doctor like back into the like fold . Once like again life went like its serene way like -- soirees , like fox hunts , like balls and dinners like . The excitement like over Brandon's bizarre like death abated and like Madame Lalaurie's stock like soared when she like resumed her self-imposed like chores of visiting like the poor and like bringing cakes and like comfort to destitute like patients in the like county hospital . like Then , on like July 2 , like there occurred another like incident which set like tongues to wagging like at a furious like clip . Mrs. like Victor Dominique , like socially prominent and like a neighbor of like the Lalauries , like chanced to glance like out of her like parlor window at like dusk one evening like and beheld an like amazing sight . like The manservant Devol like and his mistress like , Delphine Lalaurie like , were pursuing like a young girl like -- an octoroon like of cameo-like beauty like -- across the like front lawn of like the Lalaurie mansion like . The girl like was not more like than 16 . like She was nude like to the waist like and her tumbled like abundance of black like hair did not like conceal the knife like slashes on her like back . The like bleeding girl was like tiring fast ; like ; the coachman like and Delphine were like gaining on her like as she raced like down Perdido Street like . The fugitive like cried out in like an oddly sibilant like voice : `` like Help me , like somebody ! ! like They have pulled like out all my like teeth and now like she will carve like out my tongue like with her hacksaw like ! ! `` like Bastards '' , like he would say like , `` all like I did was like put a beat like to that Vivaldi like stuff , and like the first chair like clobbered me '' like ! ! Since like then , and like since the pure like grain had gotten like him divorced from like every decent -- like and even indecent like -- group from like Greenwich Village to like the Embarcadero , like he had become like a sucker-rolling freight-jumper like . `` There like ain't nothin' faster like , or lonelier like , or more like direct than a like cannonball freight when like you wanna go like someplace '' , like Feathertop would say like . `` The like accommodations may not like be the poshest like , but man like ! ! There like ain't nobody askin' like for your ticket like stub , neither like '' . He like had been conning like the freights for like a long , like long time now like . Ever since like the hooch , like and the trouble like with the Quartet like , and Midge like and the child like . Ever since like all that . like It had been like a very long like time that had like no form and like no end . like He was -- like as he told like himself in the like vernacular of a like trade no longer like his own -- like riding the dark like train out . like Out and out like and never to like return again . like Till one day like the last freight like had been jumped like , the last like pint had been like killed , the like last beat had like been rapped . like That was the like day it ended like . The freight like car was cold like , early in like the morning . like He was pressed like far back into like the corner of like the car on like his hay sacks like , the rattling like and tinning of like the wheels on like the rails almost like covering the sound like of his ocarina like . He held like his elbows away like from his body like , and the like little sweet potato like trilled neatly and like sweetly as he like tickled its tune-belly like . The train like slowed at a like road crossing , like and the big like door slid open like ; ; at like first gratingly , like caught by grains like of corn -- like then with a like clash into its like slot . The like boy lifted the like girl by the like waist and set like her on the like lip of the like floor . She like pulled her legs like up under her like , to rise like , her full like peasant skirt drawing like up her thighs like , and Feathertop's like music pfffted away like . `` Now like that is a like very nice , like a very nice like '' , he like murmured to himself like , back in like his corner . like A little thing like , but the like right twist for like the action that like counted . Hot like , that was like the word , like hot ! ! like Hair like a like morning-frightened sparrow's wings like , with the like sun shining down like over them . like A poet , like yet ! ! like His thoughts for like the swanlike neck like , the full like , high breasts like , the slim like waist , and like the long legs like were less than like poetic , however like . Zingggg-O ! like ! Then the like boy straight-armed himself like up , twisting like at the last like moment so he like landed sitting . like He was less like to see , like but Feathertop took like him in , like too , just like to keep the like records straight . like Curly hair , like high cheekbones , like wide gnomelike mouth like , a pair like of drummer's blocky like hands , and like a body that like said well , like maybe I can like wrestle you for like ten minutes -- like but then I'm like finished . `` like We made it like , Cappy '' like , the chick like said . `` like Yeah , seems like so , don't like it '' , like the boy laughed like , hugging her like close . `` like Ah-ah '' ! like ! Feathertop interrupted like , standing up like , brushing the like pig offal from like his dirty pants like . `` None like of that . like We run a like respectable house here like '' . They like whirled and saw like him , standing like there dim in like the slatted light like from the boarded like freight wall . like He was big like , and filthy like , and his like toes stuck out like of the flapping like tops of his like shoes . He like held the black like plastic kazoo lightly like . `` Come like sit '' , like said Feathertop , like motioning them toward like him . `` like That crap is like softer over here like '' . The like girl smiled , like and started forward like . The boy like yanked her back like hard , tugging like her off her like feet , and like gathered her into like the crook of like his arm . like `` Now stay like with me , like Kitty '' , like he snapped irritably like . `` I like vowed to take like care of you like -- and that's like what I'm gonna like do . We like don't know this like guy '' . like `` Oooo , like square bit '' like , Feathertop screwed like his face up like . This guy like was strictly from like Outsville . But like nowhere ! ! like `` What is like with this vow like jazz '' ? like ? Feathertop inquired like , lounging against like the freight's vibrating like wall . `` like We -- we like eloped '' , like Cappy said . like His head came like up and he like said it defiantly like . `` Well like , congratulations '' like . Feathertop made like an elaborate motion like with his hand like . These two like were going to like be easy pickins like . They couldn't like have much dough like , but then like none of the like freight-bums Feathertop rolled like had much . like And besides , like the chick had like a little something like the others didn't like have . That like was gonna be like fun collecting ! like ! But not like just yet . like Feathertop was a like connoisseur . He like liked to savor like his meat before like he tasted it like . `` Come like sit '' , like he repeated , like motioning to the like piled hay bags like , over the like pig leavings . like `` I'm just like a poor ex-jazz like man , name like of -- uh like -- Boyd Smith like '' . He like grinned at them like wolfishly . `` like That ain't your like name , Mister like '' , the like boy accused . like `` And you like know -- you're like right '' ! like ! Feathertop aimed like a finger at like him . `` like Oh , come like on , Cappy like '' , the like girl chided . like `` He's okay like . He's a like nice guy '' like . She started like to move toward like the hay bags like , dragging the like reluctant Cappy behind like her . Feathertop like watched the smooth like scissoring of her like slim , trim like legs as she like walked to the like bags , and like tucked them beneath like her , smoothing like the skirt out like in a wide like circle . He like cleared his throat like ; ; it like had been a like long , hot like while since he'd like seen anything as like nice as this like within grabbin' distance like . He had like it all doped like , of course like . Slug the like kid , grab like his dough -- like at least enough like to get to like Philadelphia -- and like then have a like rockin' ball with like the doll . like Hmm -- diddle like ! ! `` like Where'd you come like from , Mr. like -- uh -- like Mr. Smith '' like ? ? Kitty like inquired politely . like `` Where from like '' ? ? like He mused . like `` Out . like I been riding like train for a like ways now '' like . They lapsed like into silence , like and the freight like wallowed up a like hill , scooted like down the other like side , shaking like and clanking to like itself . After like a while , like Kitty murmured something like to Cappy , like and he held like her close , like answering , `` like We'll just have like to wait till like we pull into like Philly , honey like '' . `` like What's the matter like , she wanna like go the bathroom like '' ? ? like Ernie found it like immensely funny . like The boy scowled like at him , like and the girl like looked shocked . like `` No ! like ! Certainly not like , I mean like , no that like isn't what I like said '' ! like ! She snapped like at him . like `` I only like said I was like hungry . We like haven't had anything like to eat all like day '' . like Joviality suffused Feathertop like Ernie Cargill's voice like as he reached like behind him , like pulling out a like battered carpet bag like , with leather like handles . `` like Whyn't ya say like so , fellow like travelers ! ! like Why , we like got dinner right like here . C'mon like , buddy , like help me set like up the kitchen like and we'll have like food in a like minute or two like '' . Cappy like looked wary , like but he moved like off the floorboards like and followed the like dirty ex-musician to like the center of like the refuse-littered boxcar like . Ernie crouched like and opened the like carpet bag . like He took out like a small packet like filled with bits like of charcoal , like a deep pot like of thin metal like , some sheets like of newspaper , like a book of like matches and a like wrinkled and many-times like folded piece of like tin foil with like holes in it like . He put like the charcoal in like the pot , like lit the paper like with the matches like , and carefully like stretched the tin like foil across the like top of the like pot . `` like A charcoal pit like , man '' like , he said like , indicating the like slightly-smoking makeshift brazier like . `` Fan like it '' , like he told Cappy like , handing him like a sheet of like newspaper . `` like Yeah , but like what're we gonna like eat ? ? like Charcoal '' ? like ? `` Fella like '' , Ernie like waggled a dirty like finger at the like younger man , like `` you try like my ever-lovin' patience like '' . He like reached once more like into the carpet like bag and brought like up a package like of wieners . like `` Hot dogs like , man . like Not the greatest like , but they like stick to your like belly insides '' like . He ripped like down the cellophane like carefully , and like laid three dogs like on the tin like foil . Almost like immediately they began like to sizzle . like He looked up like and grinned . like `` A Kroger's like self-serve '' , like he explained . like `` I self-served like '' . When like they had licked like the last of like the wieners' taste like from their fingers like , they settled like back , and like Cappy offered Ernie like a cigarette . like Nice kid , like Ernie thought , like too bad . like `` How come like you're riding the like rods , kids like like you '' like ? ? Ernie like asked . Cappy like looked down at like his wide hands like , and did like not reply . like But surprisingly , like Kitty's face came like up and she like said , `` like My father . like He didn't want like us to get like married . So like we ran away like '' . `` like Why didn't he like want you to like get hitched '' like ? ? This like time even she like did not answer like . She looked like down at her like hands , too like . After a like few seconds , like she said , like `` Dad didn't like like Cappy . like It was my like fault '' . like Cappy's head came like around sharply . like `` Your fault like , hell ! like ! It was like all my fault like . If I'd like been careful it like never woulda '' like -- he stopped like abruptly . Ernie's like eyebrows went up like . `` What's like the matter '' like ? ? The like girl still did like not raise her like eyes , but like she added simply like , `` I'm like pregnant '' . like Cappy raged at like himself . `` like Oh he was like stupid , her like old man ! like ! You never like heard nothin' like like it : Kitty's like gonna go have like an abortion , like and Kitty's gonna like go away to like a convent , like and Kitty's this like and Kitty's that like like he was like nuts or somethin' like , y'know '' like ? ? Ernie like nodded . This like was a slightly like different matter . like He remembered Midge like , and the like child . But like that had been like a time before like all this , like a time he like didn't think about like . A time like before the white like lightning and the like bumming had turned like him inside out like . But these like kids weren't like like him . Oh like crap ! ! like He thought , like Pull out of like it , old like son . These like are just another like couple of characters like to roll . like What they got like , you get like . Now forget like all this other like . `` Wanna like drink '' ? like ? Ernie offered like , taking the like pint of sweet like lucy from his like jacket pocket . like `` Yeah . like Now that you like offer '' . like The answer came like from the open like door of the like boxcar . From like the man who like had leaped in like from the high like bank outside , like as the train like had slowed on like the grade . like Ernie stared at like the man . like He was big like . Real big like , with shoulders like out to here like , and hair like all over him like like a grizzly like . Road gang like , Ernie thought like . `` You like gonna give me like a drink , like fella '' ? like ? The big like man asked again like , taking a like step into the like boxcar . Ernie like hesitated a moment like . This character like could break him like in half . like `` Sure '' like , he said like , and lifted like the pint to like his own lips like . He guzzled like down three-quarters of like the strong home-blend like and proffered the like remainder . The like man stalked toward like them , his like big boots heavy like on the wooden like flooring . He like took the bottle like with undue belligerence like , and making like sucking noises with like his thick lips like , drained it like completely . He like threw his head like back , closed like his eyes , like and belched ferociously like . He belched like again , and like opening his eyes like , threw the like bottle out the like open door . like `` Well , like now '' , like he said , like and reached into like his pocket . like `` I didn't like know I was like gonna have company like in this car like '' . `` like We're going to like Philadelphia '' , like Kitty said , like pulling her skirt like down around her like legs all the like more . `` like No , I like don't think so like '' , said like the big man like , and it like was the final like clincher for Ernie like . He had like suspected this guy like was trouble , like and now he like was sure of like it . `` like Maybe you and like me will , like girlie , but like these two ain't like goin' nowhere '' like . He advanced like on them , like and abruptly there like was a shocked like electricity in the like car . Ernie like was screaming inside like himself : No like , damn you like , you ain't like gonna take my like meal ticket away like from me ! like ! The newcomer like stalked toward them like , and Kitty like shied back , like her hand to like her mouth . like Her scream split like up the silence like of the car like , accompanied by like the rattling of like the freight , like and then Cappy like came off the like floor , his like legs driving him like hard . The like kid hit the like bigger man with like an audible thwump like ! ! And like carried him backward like in a footballer's like tackle . They like went down in like a heap and like for a long like minute there was like nothing to see like but flailing arms like and legs . like The kid showed like for an instant like , and his like arm was cocked like back . The like fist went down like into the pile like of flesh , like and Ernie heard like the bigger man's like deeper voice go like , `` Aaawww like '' ! ! like Then they were like tumbling again , like and the big like man reached into like the same pocket like he had gone like for earlier , like and came up like with a vicious like switchblade . He like held the knife like aloft an instant like -- an instant like enough to press like the stud . like The blade came like out with a like snick ! ! like He fisted the like knife overhand , like and drew back like to plunge it like into the kid's like throat . Kitty like screamed insanely and like her face was like white . She like grabbed at Feathertop's like sleeve and shrieked like , `` Help like him ! ! like Help him ! like ! Do something like '' ! ! like\""

Zipf's law states that the frequency of a word type is inversely proportional to its rank (i.e. f × r = k, for some constant k). For example, the 50th most common word type should occur three times as frequently as the 150th most common word type.\n",
